Use Restrictions

<!--LI 2 Paragraph 1-->
The Program is capable of being used as a medical device data system to transfer, store, and convert data from one format to another. The Program may occasionally transmit data to bedside medical devices (e.g., for polling and telemetry). However, the Program itself is not a medical device.


</p>
<p>
<!--LI 2 Paragraph 2, pre-bullets-->
The following uses of the Program are prohibited:


<br />


<!--LI 2 Paragraph 2, bullets-->
a. use to control any bedside medical device for clinical, therapeutic or treatment purposes (for example, but without limitation, the administration of medication, anaesthetics, saline solutions and the like);
<br />
b. use for active patient monitoring (i.e., where the Program is used as the sole means of monitoring life-critical patient data , e.g. heart rates);
<br />
c. use for decision support (i.e., where the Program is used as the main basis to determine patient-specific treatment or immediate clinical action); or
<br />
d. use in any active monitoring that depends on the timeliness of data transmission.
