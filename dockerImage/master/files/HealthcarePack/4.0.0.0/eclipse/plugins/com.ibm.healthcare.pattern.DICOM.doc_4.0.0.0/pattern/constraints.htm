<div>
    <p class="shortdesc">
    A number of constraints apply when you use the Healthcare: Web service to DICOM pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can use the 
    <span>
    Healthcare: Web service to DICOM
    </span>
    pattern only if you meet all of the following constraints:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Requests must be received as SOAP messages over HTTP.
        </li>
        <li>
            Requesting applications must support a synchronous request response interaction 
            style.
        </li>
        <li>
            Requesting applications must support the XML format for search criteria and 
            results defined by the Healthcare: Web service to DICOM pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
            The DICOM PACS must support C-MOVE commands if the DICOM instances are moved to 
            a destination application.
        </li>
        <li>
            The DICOM PACS must support either the patient or study query root for C-FIND 
            commands.
        </li>
        <li>
            If logging or error handling is required, the format used by the Healthcare: Web service to DICOM pattern is 
            assumed to meet your requirements.
        </li>
    </ul>
