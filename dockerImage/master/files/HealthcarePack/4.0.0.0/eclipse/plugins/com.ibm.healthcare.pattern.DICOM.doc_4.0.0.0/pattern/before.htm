    <div class="p">
        <p class="shortdesc">Before applying the pattern to produce a pattern instance, complete
        one or more of the following tasks, if required:</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Identify that the Healthcare: Web service to DICOM pattern meets your business requirement and can be supported 
            by both the requester application and PACS.
        </li>
        <li>
            Define, or identify the DICOM PACS application and ensure it supports the C-FIND and C-MOVE commands.
        </li>
        <li>
            Name the pattern instance. Identify the purpose of the pattern application so that you can 
            choose an appropriate name.
        </li>
        <li>
            Decide whether you require logging and error messages. If either of these are required, you must decide to 
            which queue manager and queue the messages are sent. You can send messages to a general queue that is used 
            by multiple message flows, or you can use a queue specifically for the pattern instance.
        </li>
    </ul>
