    <h2>IBM Integration Bus Deployment</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Create the BAR file and add your message flow to it:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Click <span class="uicontrol">File &gt; New &gt; BAR file</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enter the name of your application or select one from the displayed list. The 
                    list is filtered to show only projects in the active working set.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enter a name for the BAR file that you are creating.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.
                    A file with a <span class="filepath">.bar</span> extension is created and is displayed in the 
                    Application Development view, under the <span class="filepath">BARs</span> folder. The BAR file editor opens.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the Prepare tab, select the generated application to add it to your BAR file.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select <span class="uicontrol">Compile and in-line resources</span> and then click <span class="uicontrol">Build and Save</span> to create your BAR file.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Configure the BAR file. Further configuration of the message flow in the broker archive  
            file is not required before you deploy the message flows for your
            <span>Healthcare: Web service to DICOM</span> pattern instance, 
            but you might want to review some of the default options and configure changes for your environment.
            
            In the BAR file editor, on the Manage tab:
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <span>Optional: Use the <span class="msobjprop">LoggingOn</span> user-defined 
                    property to select whether logging is on or off for the web service message flow.</span>
                </li>
                <li>Optional: Use the <span class="msobjprop">ErrorLoggingOn</span>
                    user-defined property to select whether error messages are generated.
                </li>
                <li>Optional: You can change any of the configurable properties in the BAR file,
                     for example, properties for security or creating additional instances.                 
                    <p>You must ensure that any values that you change do not affect the behavior 
                    of the pattern instance.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Create queues. <span>WebSphere MQ</span> queues must be created if they do not already exist for the error
            and log messages.
            <ol>
                <li>Create <span>WebSphere MQ</span> queues. You can create <span>WebSphere MQ</span>
                    resources either on the command line by using programs and 
                    utilities such as <span class="cmdname">runmqsc</span>, or by using the
                    <span>WebSphere MQ</span> graphical interface. For more information about creating
                    <span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources, see the 
                    <span>WebSphere MQ</span> product documentation, available on the 
                    <a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/library/" target="_blank">WebSphere 
                    MQ library</a> web page.
                    
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Deploy the BAR file to an integration server.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    After you have created a BAR file that contains your pattern, you can test it by using the DICOM test application. 
    You can use the DICOM test application to send and receive DICOM messages, and to send and receive web service messages. 
    For more information about using the DICOM test application, see "Using the DICOM test application" in the IBM Integration Bus 
    Healthcare Pack documentation.
