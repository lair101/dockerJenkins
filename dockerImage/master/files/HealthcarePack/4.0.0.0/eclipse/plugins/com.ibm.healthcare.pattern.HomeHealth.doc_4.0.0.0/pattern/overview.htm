	<p>Use the Healthcare: Home Health pattern to accept web service
		requests from mobile or PC devices, that send data from Home Health
		devices.</p>

	<div class="section">
		<h2 class="sectiontitle">Context</h2>
		<p>Patients possess Home Health devices, for example scales or
			heart monitors, that they can use to measure their health. These
			devices connect to an Application Hosting Device, for example a
			mobile or home PC, that can forward this information. A medical
			professional needs to know the readings from the the AHDs,
			so that they can monitor the health of their patients. To accurately
			monitor the health of their patients, regular readings are necessary.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h2 class="sectiontitle">Objective</h2>
		<p>
			A medical professional wants to receive data from Home Health devices
			over a Wide Area Network (WAN), and to view the data in their
			requesting application. They require a system that integrates their
			requesting application with an AHD that receives information from the
			Home Health device. This system must be able to receive messages of
			the HL7 message type <span class="msobjpropval">Unsolicited
				Observation Results </span>(ORU_R01), and to return acknowledgments that
			the messages are received.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h2 class="sectiontitle">Solution</h2>
		<p>The Healthcare: Home Health pattern is a development
			accelerator that provides the following features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Flows and subflows that extract and verify the HL7 message
				type <span class="msobjpropval">Unsolicited Observation Results </span>(ORU_R01)
				from received SOAP requests.</li>
			<li>User-defined processing of the received message.</li>
			<li>Sending of the appropriate acknowledgment back to the client.</li>
			<li>Configurable service scripts that you can use to set up security, using SAML.</li>
