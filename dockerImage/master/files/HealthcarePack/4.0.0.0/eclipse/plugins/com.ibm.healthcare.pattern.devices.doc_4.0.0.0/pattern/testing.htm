    Use the following information to help you to test the
    <span>

    pattern.

    <a name="setup"></a> <h2 class="sectiontitle">Basic pattern instance setup</h2>
    <p>
    The main message flows of the pattern instance are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            MedicalDevices
        </li>
        <li>
            TransformAndRoute
        </li>
        <li>
            Sender
        </li>
        <li>
            PatientIdentifiers
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    You must ensure that you have all the queues set up for the pattern instance, 
    see the &quot;Queues&quot; section in <a href="management.htm">Managing a 
    Healthcare: Medical devices to EMR pattern instance</a>.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <a name="flow"></a> <h2 class="sectiontitle">Flow of information through the 
    pattern instance</h2>
    <p>
    When you deploy an instance of the Healthcare: Medical devices to EMR pattern, 
    information flows in the following sequence:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The MedicalDeviceInput node locates its configurable service to determine which 
            medical devices to connect to and what measurements to collect.
        </li>
        <li>
            The MedicalDeviceInput reads a medical device measurement and propagates the 
            information as a message into the MedicalDevices message flow.
        </li>
        <li>
            The MedicalDevices message flow adds an expiry time and sends the message to the 
            RXF queue for the TransformAndRoute message flow.
        </li>
        <li>
            The TransformAndRoute message flow converts the device message into an HL7 
            observation result. The message is published out in an HL7 canonical format for 
            other applications to consume. The observation result is associated with the 
            current patient identifier for that device and then written to the DEST queue.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Sender message flow sends the HL7 message to the EMR, which responds with an 
            ACK.
        </li>
        <li>
            The ACK message is processed by the Sender flow.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    All flows also have an exception handling subflow that handles any problems that 
    are caught by the flow.
    </p>
    <p>
    The HL7 test application can be used during development to simulate the 
    receiving EMR. Start the test application and start a TCP/IP MLLP listener. The 
    test application will receive and display the observation results sent by the 
    pattern instance.
    </p>
    <p>
   	To start the HL7 test application, complete the following steps:
    <ol>
    	<li>Click <span class="uicontrol">File > New > Other</span>.</li>
    	<li>In the <span class="uicontrol">Healthcare</span> folder, select 
    		<span class="uicontrol">HL7 Test Application</span> and click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</li>
    	<li>Enter a container and filename for the test application settings and click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>. 
    		The HL7 test application starts.</li>
    </ol>
