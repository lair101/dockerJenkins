    <p>
    The
    <span>
    Healthcare: HL7 to HL7
    </span>
    pattern integrates an application that can send Health Level Seven International 
    (HL7) v2 messages with one or more applications that can receive HL7 messages. 
    The applications must be capable of sending and receiving HL7 messages by using 
    Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP) over TCP/IP.
    </p>

<div>
	<p><b>Note:</b> The Healthcare: HL7 to HL7 pattern was made available in IBM WebSphere Message Broker Connectivity Pack 
	for Healthcare Version 7.0 and is still available and supported in this version of 
	IBM Integration Bus Healthcare Pack. However, it is recommended that you
	use the Healthcare: HL7 to HL7 DFDL pattern instead if possible. The Healthcare: HL7 to
	HL7 DFDL pattern uses the DFDL message model instead of MRM and the HL7v25P message set.
	The DFDL message model has the following benefits:
	<ul>
		<li>DFDL is an open-standard format whereas MRM and the HL7v25P message set are proprietary to IBM Integration Bus
		</li>
		<li>The DFDL editor provides simpler tools for developing and testing extensions to the HL7 schema, compared to 
		MRM and the HL7v25P message set
		</li>
		<li>The DFDL message model supports HL7 versions 2.7, 2.6, 2.5.1 and earlier whereas MRM and the HL7v25P message
		set only support HL7 version 2.5.1 and earlier
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Important!</h2>
    <p>
    You must deploy the HL7 message set to your integration node before deploying a pattern 
    instance. The message set is used to parse HL7 messages as they are processed by 
    the message flows. Message flows generated by the pattern cannot be deployed to 
    your integration node until the message set has been deployed.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can import the HL7 message set into your workspace from the <a href="resources.htm"
    title="Resources for the pattern">Resources for the pattern</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>
    The HL7 message set takes a long time to build and can significantly slow down 
    your workspace - you are therefore recommended to do the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Import the HL7 message set into your workspace
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the HL7 message set to a BAR file
        </li>
        <li>
            Deploy the BAR file to your integration node
        </li>
        <li>
            Delete the HL7 message set and BAR file from your workspace
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    If you want to use the Graphical Mapper for message transformations, you will 
    need to leave the HL7 message set in your workspace. You can reduce the time it 
    takes to build the message set by deleting the HL7 chapters from the message set. 
    Leave the
    <span class="filepath">
    segments.mxsd
    </span>
    ,
    <span class="filepath">
    fields.mxsd
    </span>
    and
    <span class="filepath">
    datatypes.mxsd
    </span>
    message definition files in the message set as they are required by the pattern.
