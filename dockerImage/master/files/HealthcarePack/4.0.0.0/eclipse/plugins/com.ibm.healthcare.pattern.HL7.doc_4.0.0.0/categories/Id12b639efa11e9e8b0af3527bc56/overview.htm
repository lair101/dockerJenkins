	</div>
	<h3>Healthcare: HIPAA to XML pattern</h3>
	<p>
		The <span>Healthcare: HIPAA to XML</span> pattern generates
		a message flow that you can use to transform HIPAA files to XML files.
	</p>
	<div class="image">

	</div>
	<h3>Healthcare: HL7 Transformation pattern</h3>
	<p>
		The <span>Healthcare: HL7 Transformation</span> pattern generates
		graphical data maps that you can use to assemble HL7 messages.
	</p>
	<div class="image">

			alt="A diagram showing the Healthcare: HL7 Transformation" />
	</div>
	<h3>Healthcare: HL7 to HL7 DFDL pattern</h3>
	<p>
		The <span>Healthcare: HL7 to HL7 DFDL</span> pattern integrates an
		application that can send HL7 v2 messages with one or more
		applications that can receive HL7 messages. The applications must be
		capable of sending and receiving the messages by using MLLP over
		TCP/IP. This pattern uses the DFDL message model. An alternative version of 
		this pattern, called the <span>Healthcare: HL7 to HL7</span> pattern is provided 
		if you want to use MRM and the HL7v25P message set instead of DFDL. 
	</p>

	</div>

	<h3>Healthcare: Medical devices to EMR pattern</h3>
	<p>
		The <span> Healthcare: Medical devices to EMR </span> pattern
		integrates medical devices with an Electronic Medical Record (EMR)
		application that can receive Health Level Seven International (HL7) v2
		observation result messages (ORU R01). The application must be capable
		of receiving HL7 ORU R01 messages by using Minimal Lower Layer
		Protocol (MLLP) over TCP/IP.
	</p>

	</div>

	<h3>Healthcare: Web service to DICOM pattern</h3>
	<p>
		Use the <span> Healthcare: web service to DICOM </span> pattern to
		integrate an application written using web services with DICOM
		applications that support C-FIND and C-MOVE operations. You can use
		the pattern to query patients, studies, series and images from a DICOM
		archive (PACS) using a web service implemented by IBM Integration Bus.
	</p>
	<div class="image">
		<img src="DICOM.png"
			alt="A diagram showing the behavior of the Healthcare: web service to DICOM pattern." />
	</div>
	<h3>Healthcare: Home Health pattern</h3>
	<p>
		Use the <span>Healthcare: Home Health</span> pattern to enable your
		health systems to accept web service requests from HL7 v2.6-compliant
		devices. This allows data that Home Health devices collect and send to
		the Application Hosting Device (AHD) to then be sent to the requesting
		clinical application.
	</p>
	<div class="image">
		<img src="health_home.png"
			alt="A diagram showing the behavior of the Healthcare: Home Health pattern." />
	</div>
	<h3>Healthcare: Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager pattern</h3>
	<p>
		Use the <span>Healthcare: Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager</span> pattern to create a Patient Identifier 
		Cross-reference Manager that you can use with the IHE PIX profile, to add patients to an EMPI and retrieve patient IDs.
	</p>
	<h3>Healthcare: Patient Demographics Query Supplier pattern</h3>
	<p>
		Use the <span>Healthcare: Patient Demographics Query Supplier</span> pattern to create a Patient Demographics Supplier
		that you can use with the IHE PDQ profile, to retrieve patient demographic information.
	</p>
	<h3>Healthcare: Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing Consumer pattern</h3>
	<p>
		Use the <span>Healthcare: Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing Consumer</span> pattern to create an integration solution  
		that you can use with the IHE XDS profile, to query a document registry and retrieve documents from a document repository.
	</p>
	<h3>Healthcare: FHIR Transformation pattern</h3>
	<p>
		Use the <span>Healthcare: FHIR Transformation</span> pattern to create an application that you can use to transform HL7 FHIR resources between 
		XML and JSON formats.
