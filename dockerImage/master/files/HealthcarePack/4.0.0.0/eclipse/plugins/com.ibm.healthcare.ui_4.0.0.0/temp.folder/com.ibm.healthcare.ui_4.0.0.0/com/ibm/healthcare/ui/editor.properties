editor_header_description= The configurable service contains device connections and measurement sets for a MedicalDeviceInput node. Edit device connections to specify\r\nconnection parameters and measurement sets for devices. Edit measurement sets to specify the medical measurements that are collected by\r\ndevices. After editing device connections and measurement sets, you must deploy the configurable service to the target broker. <a>More info</a>

devices_section_description=A device connection defines the connection that is used by a medical device. The device connection specifies the connection parameters and \r\nmeasurement set used by the device, and the device type. Devices can be connected by using a serial port or TCP/IP. 
measurement_sets_section_title=Measurement Sets
measurement_sets_section_description=A measurement set defines the measurements obtained from a medical device. A measurement set contains one or more measurements and \r\nspecifies the device type with which the measurement set can be used. A measurement set is assigned to an instance of a device in a device connection.
