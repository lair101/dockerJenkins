        	The <span>Healthcare: FHIR Transformation</span> pattern provides an application for the transformation of HL7&reg; FHIR&reg; standard Resources between the XML and JSON formats.

			Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&reg;) is a draft standard from Health Level 7 International (HL7) designed to allow the exchange of electronic health records.
			It is built upon previous standards such as HL7 version 2 and HL7 version 3, and uses XML and JSON for data representation.
			FHIR&reg; solutions can be created using components called Resources which are built around particular concepts, such as the patient or provider, as well as diagnostics and care plans.
			Systems implementing FHIR&reg; must support Resources in the XML format, but may also support Resources in the JSON format.
			You can use the <span>Healthcare: FHIR Transformation</span> pattern to create an application that reads a Resource in either XML or JSON format from the file system, and transforms it into the other format.
		</p>		
		<p>
			When you generate an instance of the <span>Healthcare: FHIR Transformation</span> pattern, a library named <span class="msobjpropval">FHIRDSTU1Schemas</span> is created automatically.
			The library contains the FHIR&reg; XML schemas, based on Draft Standard for Trial Use 1 (DSTU 1), to allow Resources in the XML format to be validated.
			The library can also be used by nodes other than those included in the generated application to parse FHIR XML messages.
