Linux COBOL Importer driver

Usage notes:
- Set up environment with command:
	. cobenv

- To compile and generate xmi:
	IGYCCOB2 -qXMI filename.cbl

- The XMI compiler exit is also available, compile with:
	IGYCCOB2 -q"EXIT(PRTEXIT(PRTX)),XMI" filename.cbl

- The source program can be encoded using most any ASCII, EUC, or UTF-8 codepage that is installed
  on the Linux system.  LC_ALL must be set to a locale with this country code and codepage combination.
  Recommendation: For COBOL programs that use Japanese DBCS characters,
	1) export LC_ALL=ja_JP.eucjp
                  or
           export LC_ALL=ja_JP.utf8
	2) ensure that the COBOL source file is encoded in EUC or UTF-8, respectively
  Use the command:
	locale -a
  to confirm that the desired locale is installed and available on the Linux system.

- Translated  messages are supported. 
  Ensure the environment variable LANG is set to the desired locale, e.g. en_US

- Restrictions:

	- Compiling ERRMSG.cbl to get a list of all the compiler messages is not supported 
          at this time.

	- The XREF option is tolerated, but generates unsorted results in the listing.
