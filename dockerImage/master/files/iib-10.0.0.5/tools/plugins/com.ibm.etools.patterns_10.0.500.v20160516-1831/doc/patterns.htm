<h1 class="title topictitle1">Patterns</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc definition">A <dfn class="term">pattern</dfn> is a reusable
solution that encapsulates a tested approach to solving a common architecture,
design, or deployment task in a particular context.</p>
<p class="p">A pattern captures a commonly recurring solution to a problem,
addressing the goals and objectives that you want to achieve. The
specification of a pattern describes the problem that is being addressed,
why the problem is important (the value statement), and any constraints
for the solution. Patterns typically emerge from common usage and
the application of a particular product or technology.</p>
<p class="p">The <span class="keyword wintitle">Patterns Explorer</span>
view provides a catalog of patterns and provides detailed help. The
help guides you toward a suitable pattern to solve a particular problem.</p>
<p class="p">Each pattern has values known as <dfn class="term">pattern parameters</dfn>.
The pattern parameters that you configure depend on the particular
pattern and on the options that you enable for that pattern. An example
of a pattern parameter is a queue name from where messages are read.
The patterns provide defaults for nearly all pattern parameters and
help is provided to explain them. After you have configured the pattern
parameters, you generate a <dfn class="term">pattern instance project</dfn>,
which is a project that
contains a <dfn class="term">pattern instance configuration</dfn> file. This
configuration file stores the pattern parameters that you configured. Generation
also creates one or more additional projects
that typically artifacts that implement the
pattern.</p>
<p class="p">You can open the pattern instance configuration file
at any time to see the values of the pattern parameters. When a pattern
configuration file has been reopened, you can regenerate the projects. 
Regeneration deletes the generated projects
and re-creates them from scratch. The pattern instance project contains
an HTML summary file and a pattern instance configuration file. The
summary file has a section that explains any additional tasks that
might be required, such as creating queues.</p>
<p class="p">In all cases, the specification of both the problem and the solution
are indispensable parts of the pattern definition.</p>
<div class="p">A pattern can be used to generate customized solutions to a recurring
problem in an efficient way. Patterns are provided to encourage the
adoption of best practice in solution design. WebSphere products provide tools in support
of patterns that:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">give you guidance for the implementation of solutions</li>
<li class="li">increase development efficiency because resources are generated
from a set of predefined templates</li>
<li class="li">results in higher quality solutions through reuse of assets and
common implementation of aspects, such as error handling and logging</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">You can create resources from each pattern more than once to give
you unique pattern instances, each with a different configuration.
The pattern parameters that you can configure depend on the particular
pattern, and also the options that you enable for that pattern.</p>
<p class="p">You can use the patterns that are supplied with the workbench to create
resources that are used to solve specific business problems.</p>
