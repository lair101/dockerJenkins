<h1 class="title topictitle1">Patterns</h1>

<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc definition">A <dfn class="term">pattern</dfn> is a reusable
solution that encapsulates a tested approach to solving a common architecture,
design, or deployment task in a particular context.</p>

<p>A pattern captures a commonly recurring solution to a problem, addressing the goals and objectives that 
you want to achieve. The specification of a pattern describes the problem that is being addressed,
why the problem is important (the value statement), and any constraints for the solution. Patterns typically 
emerge from common usage and the application of a particular product or technology.</p>

<p>A catalog of IBM Integration patterns is provided in the IBM Integration Toolkit in the 
Patterns Explorer view. The IBM Integration patterns are divided into pattern categories. Pattern 
categories are categories that are based on pattern classification and that structure the display in the 
Patterns Explorer. The catalog provides detailed help that guides you toward a suitable Integration  
pattern to create resources that are used to solve a specific business problem.</p>

<p>The catalog of IBM Integration patterns contains built-in patterns and might also contain 
user-defined patterns. Built-in patterns cover a set of commonly encountered message flow scenarios and are 
packaged and released with IBM Integration Bus. User-defined patterns are created by a third-party 
pattern author.</p>

<p>Each pattern has values that are known as pattern parameters. Pattern parameters are parameters that 
customize and configure a IBM Integration pattern. The pattern parameters that you configure 
depend on the particular pattern, and on the options that you enable for that pattern. An example of a 
pattern parameter is a queue name from where messages are read.</p>

<p>The IBM Integration patterns provide defaults for most pattern parameters, and help is provided 
to explain them. After you have configured the pattern parameters, you generate a pattern instance project, 
which is a project that contains project references to all other projects in the workspace, relating to a 
specific pattern instance. A pattern instance project also contains a pattern instance configuration file 
that stores the pattern parameter values. This configuration file stores the pattern parameters that you 
configured. Generation also creates one or more additional IBM Integration projects that typically 
contain message flows and other IBM Integration resources that implement the pattern.</p>

<p>You can open the pattern instance configuration file at any time to see the values of the pattern parameters. 
When a pattern configuration file has been reopened, you can regenerate the IBM Integration projects. 
Regeneration deletes the generated IBM Integration projects and re-creates them from scratch. The pattern 
instance project contains an HTML summary file and a pattern instance configuration file. The summary file has 
a section that explains additional tasks that might be required, such as creating queues.</p>

<p>Some of the pattern parameters make fundamental changes to the generated resources. For example, if you 
enable logging and error handling, the generated projects contain additional message flows and ESQL scripts.</p>

<p>In all cases, the specification of both the problem and the solution are indispensable parts of the pattern definition.</p>

<p>A IBM Integration pattern can be used to generate customized solutions to a recurring problem in 
an efficient way. IBM Integration patterns are provided to encourage the adoption of preferred 
techniques in message flow design, to produce efficient and reliable flows. WebSphere products provide 
tools in support of patterns that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give you guidance for the implementation of solutions</li>
	<li>Increase development efficiency, because resources are generated from a set of predefined templates</li>
	<li>Result in higher quality solutions, through reuse of assets and common implementation of programming approaches, such as error handling and logging</li>
</ul>

<p>You can create resources from each IBM Integration pattern more than once to give you unique 
pattern instances, each with a different configuration. The pattern parameters that you can configure 
depend on the particular pattern, and also the options that you enable for that pattern.</p>
