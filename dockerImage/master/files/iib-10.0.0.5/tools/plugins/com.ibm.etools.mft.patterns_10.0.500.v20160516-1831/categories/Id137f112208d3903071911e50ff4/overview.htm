    <p>
    Worklight, an IBM company, provides an advanced mobile application platform and 
    tools software for smartphones and tablets. Worklight help organizations of all 
    sizes to develop, run and manage HTML5, hybrid, and native applications 
    using a powerful and flexible mobile IDE, next-generation mobile middleware, 
    end-to-end security and integrated management and analytics capabilities. 
    Worklight technology enables cross-platform applications without requiring 
    code translation, proprietary interpreters or unpopular programming languages.

    <p>
    Worklight consists of the following components:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Worklight Studio – the Worklight Studio is an Eclipse-based IDE, allowing 
            developers to perform all the coding and integration tasks that are required to 
            develop a fully operational application. Using Eclipse’s basic tools, 
            together with the various features provided by the Worklight Plug-in, the Studio 
            streamlines application development and facilitates enterprise connectivity.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Worklight Server – the Worklight Java-based Server is a scalable gateway 
            between applications, external services, and the enterprise backend 
            infrastructure. The Server contains security features to enable connectivity, 
            multi-source data extraction and manipulation, authentication, direct update of 
            web and hybrid apps, analytics and operational management functions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Worklight Device Runtime Components – the Worklight SDK consists of runtime 
            client APIs - essential libraries that complement the server by exposing a 
            predefined interface for accessing native device functionality. Worklight 
            utilizes the PhoneGap framework to deliver a uniform bridge between standard web 
            technologies and the native functions different mobile OSs provide.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Worklight Console – the Worklight Console is a web-based UI dedicated for 
            the ongoing monitoring and administration of the Worklight Server and its 
            deployed apps, adapters and push notifications. The Console allows you to control 
            and manage the access of apps to the enterprise network based on preset rules of 
            app version and device type as well as to customize the accompanying messages that the 
            user receives.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although individual components such as the Studio and Server can be used as 
    standalone products, users can deploy Worklight as a Mobile Consumer Application Platform 
    (MCAP) and also a Mobile Enterprise Application Platform (MEAP), enabling external 
    and internal mobile apps from a single solution.</p>
