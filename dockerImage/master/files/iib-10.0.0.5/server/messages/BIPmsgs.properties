The adapter component ''{0}'' does not define properties for connecting to a system of type ''{1}'', so cannot be used by the adapter ''{2}'' node called ''{3}'' in message flow ''{4}''. \n\nThe wrong type of adapter is being used with this node. Input nodes must use inbound adapters and Request nodes must use outbound adapters. \n\nChange the node to use the correct type of adapter. 

3513: BIP3513E: \
An attempt was made to retrieve a record from the Enterprise Information System (EIS) but more than one record matches. Primary keys: ''{2}''. Number of matches: ''{4}''. \n\nThe adapter received a request to retrieve a record but more than one record exists in the EIS. This error is typically due to the primary keys not being set correctly on the request message. Details: Error type = ''{0}''; Error code = ''{1}''; Primary keys: = ''{2}''; Error message = ''{3}''. \n\nCheck that only one entry exists that matches the required request. If more than one record is required to be retrieved, use retrieval instead. 

3491: BIP3491E: \
A failure occurred during the process of accessing events stored in a persistent event store, while initializing an adapter. \n\nThe adapter failed to initialize its internal event store that it requires for assured delivery. The adapter cannot function correctly without this store. \n\nMake sure that the integration node is set up correctly and that there are no MQSeries or files system problems. If the problem persists, contact IBM support. 

3497: BIP3497E: \
The adapter''s persistent store failed to construct an event. \n\nThe adapter''s persistent store contains corrupted data that cannot be processed. \n\nContact IBM support. 

3482: BIP3482E: \
Error committing a transaction for the adapter component ''{0}''. \n\nThere was a problem when the integration node attempted to commit a unit of work with an EIS resource that is connected to the adapter component. The request to commit the unit of work might be unexpected. \n\nCheck the EIS system log for errors. If no errors are found, stop and restart the integration server. If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

3531: BIP3531E: \
The Adapter ''{0}'' has lost a connection to the remote SAP system ''{1}''. The reason for the failure was ''{2}''. An attempt will be made to reconnect to the remote system. \n\nA connection to a remote SAP system has been lost. \n\nThe Adapter will automatically attempt to reconnect to the remote system at the interval specified in the "Connection Retry Interval" parameter in the Adapter options. Reconnection will be attempted up to the pre-configured maximum number of retries after which the flow must be restarted in order to reconnect to the SAP system. A further message will indicate if a retry attempt has succesfully reestablished a connection to the SAP system. 

3505: BIP3505I: \
The integration server ''{0}'' on integration node ''{1}'' has JDEdwards adapter components deployed to it which are being used in at least one message flow. \n\nThis integration server is running WebSphere Adapter JDEdwards nodes. \n\nNone 

3407: BIP3407E: \
The adapter node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' has been configured to use adapter component ''{2}'', but the adapter component has not been deployed yet. \n\nThe adapter component required by the node has not been deployed yet. The message node cannot be deployed while a component it requires is missing. \n\nDeploy the adapter component required by the node. 

3484: BIP3484E: \
''{0}'' \n\nAn embedded component has written the ''SEVERE'' level diagnostic message included here. \n\nRefer to the appropriate message in the embedded component''s documentation. 

3440: BIP3440I: \
An event called ''{0}'', sent from adapter component ''{1}'', has been received in adapter input node ''{2}'' in message flow ''{3}''. 

3444: BIP3444E: \
Adapter node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' failed to process a message because its message body was ''{2}'', which is not supported. \n\nThe adapter node requires a valid message body to construct a request to an external system. The last child was a header parser and could not be used. \n\nMake sure a correct message body is constructed before the message is propagated to the adapter node ''{0}''. 

3410: BIP3410E: \
The instantiation of the adapter class ''{0}'' failed. Reason: {1}. \n\nAn attempt was made to create an adapter component but it failed while being instantiated. \n\nCheck that compatible versions of the IBM Integration Toolkit and the runtime components are being used. If correct versions are being used then contact IBM Support. 

3448: BIP3448E: \
Adapter request node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' failed to create a response using the method binding ''{2}''. No data types were available for this method in the adapter component ''{3}''. \n\nThe adapter request node uses the method binding to construct a response. The method binding could not be found in the adapter component that was configured for this node. \n\nCheck that the adapter component contains the method binding shown in the message. 

3433: BIP3433I: \
The node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' has been configured to use all secondary adapters and ''{2}'' has been added to this set. \n\nYou can configure WebSphere Adapters nodes to use secondary adapters for interface information. You can extend the set of secondary adapters at operational time by deploying a new adapter that matches the criteria of adapters in the secondary set. This message reports that a new adapter is deployed that matches this criteria and therefore becomes part of the set of secondary adapters for that node. \n\nNone 

3493: BIP3493E: \
The adapter''s persistent store failed to open a connection to queue: {0}. Completion code: {1}. Reason code: {2}. \n\nThe adapter failed to initialize its internal event store, which it requires for assured delivery. The adapter uses MQSeries to store persistent events and it was unable to connect to a required queue on the queue manager. \n\nMake sure that the integration node is set up correctly and that the MQSeries queue manager is running. If the problem persists, contact IBM Support. 

3480: BIP3480E: \
Error starting a transaction for the adapter component ''{0}''. \n\nThere was a problem when the integration node attempted to begin a unit of work with an EIS resource that is connected to the adapter component. The request to start the unit of work might be unexpected. \n\nCheck the EIS system log for errors. If no errors are found, stop and restart the integration server. If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

3462: BIP3462W: \
 The timeout property has been set on SAPInput node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}''. This node is using SAPAdapter ''{2}'', which has been configured to receive asynchronous calls only; therefore, the timeout property will be ignored. \n\nThe timeout property of the SAPInput node is relevant for only synchronous calls from SAP. In the case of asynchronous calls, the timeout property will be ignored. \n\nIf you intend to make synchronous calls from SAP, re-run the Adapter Connection wizard to generate a .inadapter component that is configured to receive synchronous calls. 

3430: BIP3430E: \
The creation of a resource based on message set ''{0}'' failed. \n\nReview the following exception messages to find out the cause. \n\nNone 

3517: BIP3517E: \
A fault exception was received from the Enterprise Information System (EIS). Primary keys: ''{2}''. \n\nThe adapter received a fault exception from the EIS. Details: Error type = ''{0}''; Error code = ''{1}''; Primary keys: = ''{2}''; Error message = ''{3}''. \n\nCheck the error code and error message for the cause of the fault. 

3416: BIP3416E: \
A failure occurred during the process of committing or rolling back an adapter configuration. \n\nA failure occurred when the adapter configuration was being committed (or backed out) from the integration node repository. The integration server is now in an undefined state where some components might be deployed and others are not. \n\nRemove all deployed components from the integration server and redeploy the required components. If the problem persists, contact IBM Support. 

3411: BIP3411E: \
An attempt to set the property ''{0}'' on adapter component ''{1}'' failed because the property is not supported. \n\nThe current version of the adapter installed on the runtime does not support a property given in the adapter component configuration file. The most likely reason for this is a mismatch between the IBM Integration Toolkit and the runtime component levels. \n\nCheck that compatible versions of the IBM Integration Toolkit and the runtime components are being used. If correct versions are being used then contact IBM Support. 

3446: BIP3446E: \
Adapter request node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' failed to process a message using the method binding ''{2}''. No data types were available for this method in the adapter component ''{3}''. \n\nThe adapter request node uses the method binding to construct a request based on the incoming message. The method binding could not be found in the adapter component that was configured for this node. \n\nCheck that the adapter component contains the method binding given above. 

3412: BIP3412E: \
An attempt to set the property ''{0}'' to value ''{1}'' failed. \n\nThe current version of the adapter installed on the runtime component had a problem setting a property given in the adapter component configuration file. The most likely reason for this is a mismatch between the IBM Integration Toolkit and the runtime component levels. See the following messages for details of the error. \n\nCheck that compatible versions of the IBM Integration Toolkit and the runtime components are being used. If correct versions are being used then contact IBM Support. 

3472: BIP3472E: \
 A DataObject parsing error occurred while parsing an SAP ALE IDoc. \n\nThe DataObject parser was called with a message format of SAP ALE IDoc, but an error has caused parsing to stop. \n\nReview further error messages to identify the cause of the errors. 

3498: BIP3498I: \
The node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' is propagating username ''{2}'' from the message to the EIS system.. \n\nThe security profile for the ''{0}'' WebSphere Adapters node is set to propagate the identity in the message to the EIS system. The identity in the message is determined to be ''{2}'' and was taken from the IdentityMapped- or IdentitySource- elements in the Properties folder. \n\nNone 

3495: BIP3495E: \
The adapter''s persistent store failed to put an event to queue: {0}. Completion code: {1}. Reason code: {2}. \n\nThe adapter failed to put an event to its internal event store. \n\nCheck that the queue is available for putting. 

3463: BIP3463E: \
 The SAPReply node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' has found a reply identifier of ''{2}'' in location ''{3}'' but can not cast it to a byte array. Its type is: ''{4}'' \n\nA SAPReply node has found a reply identifier at the location specified but it is not a byte array. \n\nEnsure that you have copied a valid reply identifier to the correct location. 

3418: BIP3418E: \
The adapter component ''{0}'' does not define properties for connecting to a system of type ''{1}'', so cannot be used by the ''{2}'' adapter input node ''{3}'' in message flow ''{4}''. \n\nThe wrong type of adapter is being used with this node. The node must be the right type of node for the adapter it is trying to use. For example, a SAPInputNode must use a SAP adapter. \n\nChange the node to use the correct type of adapter. 

3459: BIP3459I: \
 The SAPReply node ''{0}'' has found a reply identifier of ''{1}'' at ''{2}'' \n\nAn SAPReply node has found a reply identifier at the location specified by the SAP Reply Identifier property. \n\nNo action required 

3445: BIP3445E: \
 Adapter request node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' failed to process a message because it does not contain any elements with a name of type ''{2}''. \n\nThe adapter request node received a message without any fields that it could use. \n\nMake sure a correct message body is constructed before the message is propagated to the adapter request node. 

3438: BIP3438I: \
Method name ''{0}'' was found in adapter ''{1}'' by node ''{2}'' in flow ''{3}'' with an input type of ''{4}'' and output type of ''{5}''. \n\nYou can configure WebSphere Adapters nodes to use secondary adapters for interface information. Interface information includes a list of method names and, for each method, the message type that is used as input, and the message type that is used as output. This message reports details of a method definition that is used by a node and it indicates which adapter provides this definition. \n\nRefer to the node properties to determine whether this adapter is the primary adapter or a secondary adapter. If this adapter set is the one from which you expect to access this method, no further action is necessary. Review later messages (such as BIP3439) to identify the condition where method names clash between two adapters. 

3515: BIP3515E: \
An attempt was made to retrieve ''{4}'' records from Enterprise Information System (EIS) but this exceeds the maximum number of records allowed. Primary keys: ''{2}''. \n\nThe adapter received a request to retrieve a too many records from an EIS. Details: Error type = ''{0}''; Error code = ''{1}''; Primary keys: = ''{2}''; Error message = ''{3}''. \n\nModify the request so that it retrieves fewer records or increase the maximum number allowed. 

3402: BIP3402E: \
The adapter component WSDL file contains the wrong namespace. The expected namespace is ''{0}''; the actual namespace is ''{1}''. \n\nThe deployment of the WebSphere adapter component has failed for an unexpected reason. The most likely cause is a mismatch between versions of the IBM Integration Toolkit and the runtime components. \n\nCheck that compatible versions of the runtime components and IBM Integration Toolkit are being used. If correct versions are being used then contact IBM Support. 

3457: BIP3457E: \
 A synchronous call received by SAPInput node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' in integration server ''{2}'' has timed out after ''{3}'' seconds. The reply identifier is ''{4}''. \n\nThe SAPInput node has received a synchronous callout from SAP, which expects a reply. The input node has been configured with a timeout value and the reply has not been received by any SAPReply node in this integration server during that timeout period. \n\nCheck for error BIP3452, which indicates that the reply was received but had the wrong reply identifier and could not be correlated with the outstanding callout. Check that the timeout property on the node has an appropriate value considering the period of time between the SAPInput node sending the message to be processed, and the SAPReply node receiving the reply message. If the request was sent to an external system for processing, check the system and the transport between that system and IBM Integration Bus for any indication of failures. 

3526: BIP3526E: \
The method name has been configured incorrectly for adapter request node ''{0}''. \n\nThe method name property for the node ''{0}'' has been set to a null value or an empty string and is therefore invalid. \n\nThe method name can be configured by using a property on the node or in the local environment.  If the name is set in both places, the local environment takes precedence over the node property. 

3522: BIP3522E: \
The adapter was unable to locate a required Java library. \n\nThe most likely cause of this exception is that the client libraries for the Enterprise Information System (EIS) are missing from the system. The EIS client libraries are not supplied with the IBM Integration Bus product and have to be obtained separately from the EIS provider. If the EIS client libraries have been installed and the integration node has been configured to use them then make sure they have the correct permissions and that configurable service points to the correct location. The missing resource which caused this problem was: ''{0}''. If the problem persists then it might be due to an internal problem with the product. \n\nObtain the missing client libraries from the EIS vendor and configure the integration node to have access to these files using mqsichangeproperties command. If you are using SAP then ensure you have JCO3 and not JCO2. Consult the documentation for the exact details (topic an09140). If this is not the cause of the missing class exception then contact IBM support. 

3481: BIP3481E: \
Error completing a transaction for the adapter component ''{0}''. \n\nThere was a problem when the integration node attempted to complete a unit of work with an EIS resource that is connected to the adapter component. The request to complete the unit of work might be unexpected. \n\nCheck the EIS system log for errors. If no errors are found, stop and restart the integration server. If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

3453: BIP3453E: \
Adapter input node ''{0}'' failed to process an event called ''{1}'' from adapter component ''{2}''. \n\nInbound adapter component ''{2}'' has delivered an event called ''{1}'' to the input node ''{0}''. An error occurred during the conversion of this event to an IBM Integration Bus message. See the following message to determine the cause of the error. \n\nNone 

3417: BIP3417E: \
Adapter component ''{0}'' does not contain any method bindings. \n\nIf the adapter component does not have any method bindings then it does not contain any useful configurations. All calls to the adapter component are made using the method bindings. \n\nReview the adapter component configuration and make sure it has at least one method binding. 

3421: BIP3421E: \
The adapter component ''{0}'' is not an outbound adapter so cannot be used by the adapter request node ''{1}'' in message flow ''{2}''. \n\nThe wrong type of adapter is being used with this node. Input nodes must use inbound adapters and Request nodes must use outbound adapters. \n\nChange the node to use the correct type of adapter. 

3450: BIP3450E: \
An adapter error occurred during the processing of a message. The adapter error message is ''{0}''. \n\nThis error was detected by the adapter. The following message describes the diagnostic information that is provided by the adapter ''{0}''. \n\nInspect the diagnostic information that is provided by the adapter. Further diagnostic information might be written to user trace. Inspect user trace for further information. 

3435: BIP3435I: \
The node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' has been configured to use secondary message sets and ''{2}'' has been added to the list of message sets used by that node. \n\nYou can configure WebSphere Adapters nodes to use secondary message sets to define message types for input or output to methods. You can extend the set of secondary message sets at operational time by deploying a new message set that matches the criteria of message sets in the secondary set. This message reports that a new message set is deployed that matches this criteria and therefore becomes part of the set of secondary message sets for that node. \n\nNone 

3454: BIP3454E: \
SAPInput Node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' has received an RFC call to ''{2}'' but is configured to accept calls to ''{3}'' only. \n\nThe SAPInput node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' has received an RFC call from SAP; however, the interface being called does not correspond to any of the interfaces that were discovered by the Adapter Connection wizard while creating the .inadapter for that node. The interface that was called from SAP was ''{2}'' and the list of interfaces expected by this node are ''{3}''. \n\nIf the SAPInput node is intended to accept this RFC call, re-run the Adapter Connection wizard for its .inadapter and discover this BAPI. If this SAPInput node is not intended to accept this RFC call, possible causes of this error are: - The incorrect RFC Destination was specified by the calling SAP program. Contact your SAP administrator. - Two inadapters have been configured with the same RFCProgram ID. In this case, it is likely that each adapter will receive RFC calls that are relevant only for the other adapter. If this is the case, either consolidate the two adapters into one adapter and a SAPInput node that can accept all RFC calls, or use two separate program IDs. 

3511: BIP3511E: \
An attempt was made to access a record in the Enterprise Information System (EIS) which does not exist. Primary keys: ''{2}''. \n\nThe adapter received a request to access a record which does not exist in the EIS. This might be due to it being deleted by another process or due to the request message tree having incorrect data. Details: Error type = ''{0}''; Error code = ''{1}''; Primary keys: = ''{2}''; Error message = ''{3}''. \n\nCheck that the record that is being be accessed exists in the EIS. 

3422: BIP3422E: \
The adapter component ''{0}'' does not define properties for connecting to a system of type ''{1}'', so cannot be used by the ''{2}'' adapter request node ''{3}'' in message flow ''{4}''. \n\nThe wrong type of adapter is being used with this node. The node must be the right type of node for the adapter it is trying to use. For example, a SAPInputNode must use an SAP adapter. \n\nChange the node to use the correct type of adapter. 

3442: BIP3442E: \
An exception occurred in adapter node ''{0}'', which is using adapter component ''{1}''.. \n\nThis message flow node ''{0}'' attempted to process a message and communicate with an EIS using an adapter component ''{1}''. An error occurred during this processing. \n\nSee the following messages for details of the error. 

3466: BIP3466E: \
 SAP inbound adapter ''{0}'' has been configured with a client definition file ''{1}'' on z/OS. \n\nThe inadapter has been started when with a client definition file specified, but this is not supported on z/OS. \n\nChange the configurable service for the inadapter to not specify a client definition file. If you want to do SAP HA you must configure a shared queue group. 

3426: BIP3426W: \
Field ''{0}'' was converted from data type ''{1}'' to ''{2}'' while reading the input to a WebSphere Adapters node. \n\nPart of the input message to a WebSphere Adapters node was found to be the wrong data type. The ''{0}'' field was data type ''{1}'' but the adapter requires it to be ''{2}''.  \nA successful attempt was made to convert the data type of the field.  \nBe aware that this conversion has a performance overhead.  \nThis situation can arise if the message set or the adapters component have been modified since running the Adapter Connection wizard, or if the node is configured to use a message set and an adapter component that were produced by running the wizard on two separate occasions. \n\nConsider if it is more efficient to create the message with the correct data type.  \nEnsure that the node is configured to use a compatible message set and adapter component. 

3409: BIP3409E: \
An attempt to create the adapter component ''{0}'' using the class ''{1}'' failed. This class is not a supported type of adapter. \n\nAn attempt was made to create an adapter component using a class not installed on the integration node. The most likely cause is a mismatch between levels of the IBM Integration Toolkit and the runtime components. \n\nCheck that compatible versions of the IBM Integration Toolkit and the runtime components are being used. If correct versions are being used then contact IBM Support. 

3451: BIP3451W: \
SAPReply node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' has been deployed to integration server ''{2}'' that has no SAPInput node. \n\nA SAPReply node replies to a BAPI call that a SAPInput node receives. If no SAPInput node is present, a SAPReply node does not have a BAPI request to which to respond. \n\nThe message flow will deploy but an error will be thrown if a message reaches the SAPReply node. Add a SAPInput node to a flow in this integration server and re-deploy. 

3429: BIP3429E: \
It was not possible to create a message set ''{0}'' for use with WebSphere Adapters nodes. \n\nReview the following exceptions for the cause. \n\nNone 

3431: BIP3431E: \
The deletion of a resource based on message set ''{0}'' failed. \n\nReview the following exception messages to find out the cause. \n\nNone 

3529: BIP3529E: \
Integration node ''{0}'' contains integration server ''{1}'' that has tried to use the WebSphere Adapter ''{2}'' configurable service ''{3}'' but it does not exist. \n\nThe configurable service does not exist. \n\nEither ensure the integration server references a configurable service that exists or run mqsichangeproperties ''{0}'' -e  ''{1}'' -o ComIbmSiebelManager -n ''{2}'' -d to delete the reference and restart the integration server. 

3471: BIP3471I: \
 Adapter''{0}'' in integration server ''{1}'' has not been configured to use a shared Transaction ID (TID) store. \n\nAn adapter is not using a shared TID store, therefore it cannot operate in a high availability setup. \n\nNone 

3521: BIP3521E: \
The ''{0}'' adapter was unable to load the Enterprise Information System (EIS) client libraries. \n\nThe ''{0}'' adapter client libraries are not supplied with the IBM Integration Bus product and have to be obtained separately from the EIS provider. If the EIS client libraries have been installed and the integration node has been configured to use them then make sure they have the correct permissions and that configurable service points to the correct location. The missing resource which caused this problem was: ''{1}''. \n\nObtain the missing client libraries from the EIS vendor and configure the integration node to have access to these files using mqsichangeproperties. If you are using SAP ensure you have JCO3 and not JCO2. Consult the documentation for the exact details (topic an09140). 

3528: BIP3528E: \
The connection properties for Siebel adapters on this integration node are being overridden by a siebel.properties file ''{0}'', but this file cannot be accessed. The test for existence returned ''{1}'', the test for read permissions returned ''{2}''. \n\nCheck that the path specified to the siebel.properties file is correct and that the file permissions allow this file to be read. \n\nTo allow the siebel.properties file to override the Siebel connection properties, correct these errors. 

3461: BIP3461I: \
 The SAPAdapter ''{0}'', used by SAPInput node ''{1}'' in message flow ''{2}'' has received a synchronous call from SAP. This call increases the number of concurrent calls to ''{3}'', which is the highest number of concurrent calls since the trace was started. \n\nThe SAP adapter can receive synchronous calls from SAP. The numberOfListeners property of the SAP .inadapter component controls the maximum number of concurrent calls.  The input parameters of these calls are sent to an SAPInput node for processing and the output parameters are received by an SAPReply node. The SAP call is blocked while it waits for the reply. The length of time between the SAPInput node propagating the message and the SAPReply node receiving the reply message can be affected by the additional instances properties. To avoid processing delays, tune the maximum number of listeners and the number of additional instances for the message flow that contains the SAPInput and SAPReply nodes. \n\nUse this information in conjunction with the advice offered in the help topic "Tuning the SAP adapter for scalability and performance". 

3458: BIP3458E: \
 SAPReply node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' in integration server ''{2}'' could not find a SAP reply identifier at location ''{3}''. \n\nThe SAPReply node did not find a reply identifier at the given location and no SAPInput node exists at the start of this message flow. \n\nEnsure that you have copied the SAP reply identifier to the location specified on the SAPReply node. If you have not changed this property, the default location is $LocalEnvironment/Destination/Adaper/Reply/ReplyIdentifier 

3494: BIP3494E: \
The adapter''s persistent store failed to browse an event from queue: {0}. Completion code: {1}. Reason code: {2}. \n\nThe adapter failed to browse an event from its internal event store. \n\nCheck that the queue is available for browsing. 

3456: BIP3456I: \
SAPReply node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' has received a message without a reply identifier in the local environment. If the corresponding SAPInput node is in the same flow, this node is used for the reply; otherwise, an exception is issued. \n\nThe SAPReply node uses a reply identifier that is generated by an SAPInput node to determine where to send the reply. If this identifier does not exist, the SAPReply node can determine where to reply to by looking for an SAPInput node in the same flow. If no SAPInput nodes exist in the flow, an error is issued by the SAPReply node. \n\nIf the SAPInput node is in the same message flow, no user action is required. If the SAPInput node is in a different flow, ensure that the reply identifier is copied to the local environment so that the SAPReply node knows where to reply to. 

3467: BIP3467E: \
 SAP inbound adapter ''{0}'' has been configured with an invalid client definition file ''{1}''. The MQ Reason code is ''{2}''. \n\nThe inadapter has been started when with a client definition file specified, but is not a valid client definition file. \n\nCheck that the client definition file exists. If it exists check that it hasn''t been corrupted. If you think it has been corrupted, regenerate the file using WebSphere MQ. 

3439: BIP3439W: \
Adapter ''{1}'' defines method name ''{0}'' with an input type of ''{4}'' and output type of ''{5}'' but it is being ignored by node ''{2}'' in flow ''{3}'' \n\nYou can configure WebSphere Adapters nodes to use secondary adapters for interface information. Interface information includes a list of method names and, for each method, the message type that is used as input, and the message type that is used as output. This message reports that a secondary adapter has defined a method that has the same name as a method that was defined by another secondary adapter. \n\nReview earlier messages (such as BIP3438) to determine which adapter first defined this method. To avoid duplication, regenerate one of the adapters and change the name of the method. The method will not necessarily be taken from the same adapter when the integration node restarts unless the method was defined in the primary adapter of the node, in which case, the node will always use that definition. 

3523: BIP3523E: \
The WebSphere MQ Classes for Java could not be found. \n\nIn order to function correctly, the SAP adapter requires the WebSphere MQ Java classes to be installed. The missing class is: ''{0}'' \n\nMake sure the client libraries have been installed as part of WebSphere MQ and that the integration node environment has the CLASSPATH and library path set up correctly. 

3408: BIP3408E: \

The ESD wizard should produce an adapter component and a message set that match in terms of the message types that are used as input and output to the adapter operations.  \nThis error can happen if the message set or the adapters component have been modified since running the ESD, or if the node is configured to use a message set and an adapter component that were produced by two separate invocations of the ESD wizard. \n\nReview the message set and ensure that the message set does include all required types. Review the adapter component and ensure that it is configured to use the correct types. Ensure that the node is configured to use an adapter component and a message set that are compatible. Rerun the ESD wizard, if necessary, to generate a message set and compatible adapter component. 

3404: BIP3404E: \
The adapter node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' has been configured to use adapter component ''{2}'', but that adapter component has not been deployed to this integration server. \n\nYou have deployed a message flow containing an adapter node but have not yet deployed the adapter component. \n\nDeploy a bar file containing the adapter component to the integration server. 

3413: BIP3413E: \
An attempt to start adapter component ''{0}'' failed. Reason: {1}. \n\nTry redeploying the adapter component. If this continues to fail then contact IBM Support. 

3414: BIP3414E: \
An attempt to attach the message flow node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' to the adapter component ''{2}'' failed. Reason: {3}. \n\nThe message flow node failed to register with the adapter component to receive events. The node cannot function correctly until it has attached to the adapter component. \n\nIdentify the adapter that is required by the node. Ensure that it is deployed to the correct integration server, and that the connection details on the .inadapter and the configurable service are correct. In addition, check the system log or Windows Event Viewer for further errors. If the problem persists, redeploy the message flow that contains the node and the adapter component that the node requires. The reason given in the error message might provide additional information about what caused the problem. 

3492: BIP3492E: \
The adapter''s persistent store failed to open a connection to queue manager: {0}. Completion code: {1}. Reason code: {2}. \n\nThe adapter failed to initialize its internal event store, which it requires for assured delivery. The adapter uses MQSeries to store persistent events and it was unable to connect to the integration node''s queue manager. \n\nMake sure that the integration node is set up correctly and that the MQSeries queue manager is running. If the problem persists, contact IBM support. 

3460: BIP3460W: \
 The timeout property has been set on the SAPInput node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}''. This node is using SAPAdapter ''{2}'', which has been configured to receive asynchronous calls only; therefore, the timeout property will be ignored. \n\nThe timeout property of the SAPInput node is relevant for only synchronous calls from SAP. In the case of asynchronous calls, the timeout property will be ignored. \n\nIf you intend to make synchronous calls from SAP, re-run the Adapter Connection wizard to generate a .inadapter component that is configured to receive synchronous calls. 

3525: BIP3525I: \
The message set ''{0}'' has been undeployed and is therefore no longer a secondary message set for node ''{1}'' in message flow ''{2}''. \n\nYou can configure WebSphere Adapters nodes to use secondary message sets to define message types for input or output to methods. You can extend the set of secondary message sets at operational time by deploying a new message set that matches the criteria of message sets in the secondary set. This message reports that the message set, which was considered to be a secondary message set for the named node, has been undeployed. \n\nNone 

3516: BIP3516E: \
A record has missing data that is required for making a request to the Enterprise Information System (EIS). Primary keys: ''{2}''. \n\nThe adapter received a request which has missing data.

3504: BIP3504I: \
The connection properties on adapter {0} are being overridden by configurable service {1} of type {2}. The properties that are configured on the configurable service are {3}. \n\nYou can create a configurable service to override the connection properties that are set on an adapter. In this case, the properties that were set on adapter {0} have been overridden because configurable service with name {1} and type {2} has been created with the following properties {3}. \n\nNo action is required if these overriding values are correct. To change the values, use the mqsichangeproperties command and specify {2} as ConfigurableService (-c parameter), and {1} as ObjectName (-o parameter). To delete the configurable service and revert to using the properties that were deployed by the adapter, run the mqsideleteconfigurableservice command and specify {2} as ConfigurableService (-c parameter), and {1} as ObjectName (-o parameter).

3437: BIP3437W: \
When merging primary message set ''{0}'' with secondary message sets, message type ''{1}'' in message set ''{2}'' caused a clash with the same type that is already defined in ''{3}'', therefore it was ignored. \n\nYou can configure WebSphere Adapters nodes to access message types from secondary message sets if they are not present in the primary message set. In this case, a primary message set ''{0}'' has been configured to use ''{2}'' as a secondary message set but it is ignoring the type ''{1}'' in that message set because it has already been defined in another message set (''{3}''). \n\nReview earlier messages (such as BIP3435) to determine in which message set this type was first defined. Regenerate the adapter and message set, and change the name or namespace of the type in one of the message sets. The type will not necessarily be taken from the same message set when the integration node is restarted unless the type is defined in the primary message set of the node, in which case the node will always use that definition. 

3485: BIP3485I: \
''{0}'' \n\nAn embedded component has written the ''CONFIG'' level diagnostic message included here. \n\nRefer to the appropriate message in the embedded component''s documentation.

The pre-existing object will be used for integration node authorization checks. \n\nThe integration node attempted to create a security object as part of integration server ''{0}'' creation, but was unsuccessful because such an object already exists. The existing object will be used, and permissions on that object will not be changed. \n\nEnsure the pre-existing object has the desired permissions. 

2853: BIP2853E: \
The integration node was unable to check authorization for role ''{0}'' (subcomponent ''{1}''). The request has been rejected owing to this error, even though the role may in fact be authorized. \n\nDuring authority checks for role ''{0}'', an error occurred that cut short the checks. The role may have the correct privileges, but this cannot be determined by the integration node. Subsequent error messages may indicate the cause of the failure. \n\nCorrect the underlying errors that prevented the integration node from performing security checks, and retry the operation. 

9142: BIP9142I: \
The integration node has stopped. \n\nNo user action required. 

2074: BIP2074E: \
A problem was detected with WebSphere MQ while issuing {0} for WebSphere MQ Queue Manager ''{1}''. MQCC={2}, MQRC={3}. \n\nThe operation on the specified queue manager returned with the indicated WebSphere MQ completion and reason code. \n\nCheck the WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes in the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference manual to establish the cause of the error, taking any appropriate action.  It may be necessary to restart the integration node after you have performed this recovery action.  If an MQOPEN was unsuccessful because the queue manager did not exist, then define this object to WebSphere MQ.  If the problem was because incorrect object names were specified, then the integration node will try to recover, if the problem persists it may be necessary to restart the integration node. 

2806: BIP2806E: \
The integration node was unable to publish to WebSphere MQ Queue ''{0}''. \n\nA publish event could not be sent because the WebSphere MQ message queue was not available. \n\nYou should investigate why the message queue was not available by reviewing the system log messages.

2033: BIP2033I: \
The integration node was forced to stop an integration server process. The process ID was {0}. \n\nThe integration server process would not stop normally and was forced to terminate.  \n This might be because the IBM Integration Bus executable bipbroker failed unexpectedly. During the automatic restart of bipbroker by the bipservice executable, all integration servers are stopped and then restarted. If executable bipbroker fails during normal shutdown, integration servers might be left running. When the integration node restarts, these integration servers are terminated and a new set of integration servers started. A system log message indicating that executable bipbroker failed unexpectedly indicates this type of problem.  \n This should be treated as an abnormal termination of the integration server and handled accordingly. \n\nInvestigate why the executable bipbroker stopped unexpectedly.  \n Ensure that any database in-doubt or uncommitted locks that are held by the integration server are dealt with.  \n Use the IBM Integration Bus documentation together with your database documentation to determine the best course of action for dealing with ''in-doubt'' units of work.  \n Contact your IBM support center if you are unable to determine the cause of the problem. 

2018: BIP2018E: \
A web user with role ''{0}'' does not have permission to subscribe to topic ''{1}''. \n\nA web user has attempted to subscribe to topic ''{1}''.  This requires that the role ''{0}'' has the necessary WebSphere MQ Topic security permissions, and that they also have GET permissions on the ''{2}'' queue so that published messages can be forwarded to web users. 

2854: BIP2854W: \
The integration node was unable to create security objects for integration server ''{0}''. The create of the integration server has succeeded, but security objects will need to be created manually.

Contact your IBM support center. 

9154: BIP9154E: \
The HTTP listener could not be started because it requires a queue manager to be specified on the integration node. \n\nThe stand-alone HTTP listener uses WebSphere MQ to communicate between the listener process and the server that runs a message flow that uses HTTP. The HTTP listener requires the queue manager that is specified on the integration node, and without it, the listener cannot run. Any message flow that requires the HTTP listener will fail to deploy, and any message flow that is already deployed will fail to start. \n\nSpecify a queue manager on the integration node, or force the use of the server-embedded listener by using the command: mqsichangeproperties <integration node name> -b httplistener -o HTTPListener -n startListener -v false 

2870: BIP2870I: \

The integration node has detected that security objects for integration server ''{0}'' are shared with at least one other integration server, and will not delete the existing object ''{1}''. \n\nThe integration node attempted to delete a security object as part of integration server ''{0}'' deletion, but has not done so because the object is in use by at least one other integration server. \n\nNone. 

8238: BIP8238E: \
The multi-instance integration node {0} has detected that another integration node instance is active. This integration node instance stops and restarts to maintain integrity of the integration node data. \n\nOnly one instance of a multi-instance integration node can be active at any time. This integration node instance has detected a problem because another instance appears to be active at the same time.  \n This error might have been caused by a network problem connecting to the server where the shared data for the integration node is stored. \n\nThe integration node instance should stop and restart automatically and the problem be resolved without the need for manual intervention.  \n If the problem persists, investigate the network shared server and all connections to it.  \n Ensure that all the mount points are still valid from client servers that host the integration node instances.  \n Investigate any problems with the WebSphere MQ multi-instance queue managers associated with this integration node. 

2813: BIP2813E: \
Integration node {0} (UUID {1}) could not process an internal configuration response message for integration server {2} to completion: missing tag ''{3}''. \n\nThe internal configuration response message returned by the integration server was incomplete. \n\nUse the system log messages to determine why the integration server failed to respond correctly. Redeploy the integration node''s configuration if you are able to resolve the problem. Contact your IBM support center if you are unable to resolve the problem. 

2039: BIP2039I: \

2066: BIP2066E: \
Integration node ''{0}'' was unable to retrieve an internal configuration response message for integration server ''{2}'' within the ''{3}'' second configuration timeout. \n\nThe integration server did not respond within the time period set by the integration node''s ConfigurationChangeTimeout parameter. This defines the maximum length of time in which an integration server can apply a configuration change, and the default value is 300 seconds. \n\nInvestigate why the integration server was unable to respond before being timed out. Use the system log messages to determine if a problem with the integration server has been reported.  \n You can increase the ConfigurationChangeTimeout parameter by using the mqsichangebroker command. Reducing the complexity of the deployment might also solve this problem.  \n Correct the problem and resubmit the configuration request. Contact your IBM support center if you are unable to resolve the problem. 

2841: BIP2841W: \
The integration node processed a web administration request. The web administration request failed due to a client error.  User ''{0}'' on host ''{1}'' made an HTTP ''{2}'' request to URL ''{3}''.

To avoid seeing this warning deploy only 32-bit integration servers to this integration node, or create an integration node on a 64-bit-capable platform and deploy the configuration to that integration node. 

2837: BIP2837I: \
Web user ''{0}'' is defined as having a role of ''{1}''.  This user will be authenticated against a local password. \n\nThe web user account has been defined in the integration node registry.  The web user account has a role of ''{1}'', which is the system account under which actions will be authorized if administration security is enabled. 

2804: BIP2804E: \
The integration node has detected that integration server {0}, process ID {1}, has not shutdown. \n\nAn attempt was made to stop an integration server process by issuing an internal configuration message to the integration server.  The integration server process has not yet shut down. \n\nUse the system Log to investigate why the integration server process could not shutdown. It is expected that the integration server will eventually shutdown normally. This message is repeated at 1 minute intervals. However, it is possible that you may need to stop the integration server manually. If the integration node was configured as a WebSphere MQ trusted application then refer to the WebSphere MQ reference manuals to determine how to stop the integration server executable. Ensure that any database locks held by the integration server are released if the process is forced to stop. Contact your IBM support center if you are unable to determine the reason for this problem. 

9149: BIP9149E: \
The integration node has detected that the MQTT broker (process ID {0}), has shut down abnormally. \n\nAn MQTT broker process ended abnormally. \n\nInvestigate the reasons for the problem.

Stop and restart the integration node. If the problem continues, restart the operating system. If the problem still continues, contact your IBM support center. 

2872: BIP2872W: \
The user ''{0}'' has made a request to deploy to the integration node using a deprecated method. \n\nA CMP application has used the BrokerProxy.deploy() method and this has been deprecated in the current product. In previous versions of IBM Integration Bus this method deployed configuration changes to an integration node. This had the effect of pausing the application until the request was completed by the integration node, and thus provided the ability to make configuration changes synchronously. As of WebSphere Message Broker V7, property changes are applied immediately and so a separate deployment step is not required. \n\nUsing this method is unnecessary and will cause your application to work more slowly. If  the CMP application is designed to wait for updates to take affect then it should be modified to use the BrokerProxy.setSynchronous() method instead. If the CMP application does not need to wait for the updates to take affect then the Broker.deploy() method call can be removed. 

2834: BIP2834E: \
The password for the web user account ''{0}'' cannot be changed because the old password did not match the one stored in the integration node registry. \n\nIn order to change the password for the web user account, the request must include the previous password for that web user. The supplied password was incorrect. \n\nCorrect the previous password and try again. If the old password has been forgotten, an integration node administrator can reset the password using the ''mqsiwebuseradmin'' command. 

2866: BIP2866I: \
IBM Integration Bus administration security is {0}. \n\nDescribes whether administration security has been activated or not for the current integration node. Administration security can be activated or inactivated by the mqsichangebroker command. \n\nNo action.

The IBM Integration Bus service has detected that its child process has ended abnormally, process ID {0}. \n\nAn executable started by the IBM Integration Bus service terminated abnormally. \n\nReview any other messages written to the system log to determine the cause of the failure. If you are unable to determine the cause of failure, contact your IBM support center. 

2826: BIP2826E: \
Integration server termination wait timer reached. There are ''{0}'' threads still executing. \n\nAn attempt was made to stop an integration server process by issuing an internal configuration message to the integration server.  The integration server process has not yet shut down. \n\nPlease refer to previous messages for more details of integration server. Use the system Log to investigate why the integration server process could not shutdown. This message is issued to enable customers to be aware of possible shutdown problems. However, it is possible that you may need to stop the integration server manually. Contact your IBM support center if you are unable to determine the reason for this problem. 

2004: BIP2004I: \
The IBM Integration Bus service is continuing. \n\nThe IBM Integration Bus service is now running. \n\nNo user action required. 

2068: BIP2068E: \
The integration node was unable to put an internal configuration message to message queue ''{0}''. \n\nThe internal configuration message could not be sent because the message queue was not available. \n\nInvestigate why the message queue was not available by reviewing messages issued to the system log.  Resolve the problem and redeploy the integration node''s configuration. 

2005: BIP2005E: \
Unsuccessful IBM Integration Bus service initialization. \n\nThe IBM Integration Bus service could not be registered. \n\nCheck that the machine has adequate memory and that the userid and password used to start the integration node are correct and that the userid is a member of the mqbrkrs group. 

2003: BIP2003W: \
The IBM Integration Bus service has paused. \n\nThe IBM Integration Bus service has paused. \n\nRestart the IBM Integration Bus service as soon as possible. 

2015: BIP2015E: \
The IBM Integration Bus service detected that executable {0} terminated, exit code {1}. \n\nAn executable terminated unexpectedly. \n\nThe IBM Integration Bus service will restart the executable automatically unless the integration node is currently shutting down. Determine the reason for the unexpected termination of this executable. 

2803: BIP2803I: \
Integration node {0} (UUID {1}) received an internal configuration response message for integration server {2} that contained no data. \n\nThe integration server failed to provide an adequate internal configuration response message. \n\nUse the system log messages to determine why the integration server failed to provide a complete internal configuration response message. You should check that your system is not running short of resources: for example, you may need to increase the IBM log size. Reducing the complexity of the deploy by reducing the number of integration servers may also help to alleviate this problem. Correct the problem and redeploy the integration node''s configuration from the Integration Toolkit, mqsideploy command or a CMP application. Contact your IBM support center if you are unable to resolve the problem. 

2882: BIP2882I: \
The resource ''{0}'' of type ''{1}'' was deleted from object ''{2}'' of type ''{3}'' with parent ''{4}'' of type ''{5}''. 

2867: BIP2867E: \
WebSphere MQ was unable to set the correct security permissions on the queue ''{0}'' for the group ''{1}''. \n\nThese permissions need to be set for integration node security to function correctly. Please set these permissions manually. \n\nUse the WebSphere MQ explorer or the setmqaut command to set the Inquire (inq), Put (put), and Set (set) permissions on the ''{0}'' queue for the group ''{1}''. 

2818: BIP2818S: \
Integration node failed to create semaphore \n\nAn internal semaphore could not be created. \n\nUse the system log messages to determine why the semaphore failed to be created. Contact your IBM support center if you are unable to resolve the problem. 

2883: BIP2883I: \
The resource ''{0}'' of type ''{1}'' was modified on object ''{2}'' of type ''{3}'' with parent ''{4}'' of type ''{5}''. 

2065: BIP2065I: \
Integration node {0} has processed a request against its internal configuration. \n\nThe Integration Toolkit, a command or a CMP application has made a request against the integration node''s internal configuration. \n\nDetermine if the request was successful by analyzing the messages following this message. 

2851: BIP2851E: \
The integration node object ''{2}'' of type ''{3}'' with uuid ''{4}'' is in stopped state. The requested operation type ''{0}'' against an object type of ''{1}'' cannot be completed. \n\nA CMP application sent a request to the integration node to complete an action on an object. Either that object is in stopped state, or the parent object is in stopped state. While the object is in stopped state, the integration node cannot complete the action. \n\nThe integration node object, and its parent object, must be running for this action to take place.

4437: BIP4437E: \
Unable to put a timeout message to the dead-letter queue ''{0}'' after processing ''{1}'' times. Error text: {2}. \n\nAn AggregateReply node detected that a timeout message had been processed {1} times. The backout threshold is set on the Aggregation queues, so backout processing was attempted. Either the backout requeue queue is not defined, or there was a previous error while attempting to put the message back on the dead-letter queue. During an attempt to put the message on the dead-letter queue ''{0}'', the following error was experienced: {2}. \n\nThe AggregateReply node discards this timeout message, but user data on the reply queue will not be affected. 

4418: BIP4418E: \
Invalid control message received by AggregateReply node ''{1}''. Missing Information : ''{0}'' \n\nAn AggregateReply node received a control message at its control terminal. The message was not in the format that was expected. The following information was expected but not found: ''{0}'' \n\nEnsure that the message received at the control terminal of the AggregateReply node was generated by the control terminal of an AggregateControl node.

4412: BIP4412W: \
Corresponding request record not found for the reply message. \n\nAn AggregateReply node has received a message at its ''in'' terminal. No corresponding record of a request message being sent could be found. See subsequent messages to determine how this situation has been handled. \n\nIt is possible that extraneous messages are arriving at the AggregateReply node ''in'' terminal. Check your flow to ensure that the only messages arriving here are replies to request messages previously sent out and passed through an AggregateRequest node. It is possible that this message is a valid reply but part of an aggregation which previously timed out. It is possible that this is a reply to a message which has not yet been recorded by an AggregateRequest node. This can happen if request messages are sent outside of transactional control. Adjust your transaction settings to ensure that messages are sent under transactional control. 

4408: BIP4408S: \
Could not allocate a thread for timeout processing in AggregateReply node. \n\nThe AggregateReply node requires a thread to perform timeout processing. This demand has been refused. Normal function cannot continue without this thread. \n\nThe operating system may have run low on threads. Try to make more threads available. Try reducing the number of threads used by a message flow by decreasing the value of the ''Additional Instances'' attribute from the ''Assignments'' panel. 

4432: BIP4432I: \
Storing a aggregation reply message persistently for subsequent processing. \n\nThe message has been stored persistently by the AggregateReply node. It will be stored until all replies for the aggregation have returned. Message details: Reply Id = ''{0}'', Reply Protocol = ''{1}''. Reply Group Id = ''{2}''. \n\nNo user action required. 

4428: BIP4428E: \
Missing aggregate request information in Environment. The missing information was in aggregate folder : ''{0}''. \n\nAn AggregateControl node attempted to process the information about individual aggregate requests. In order to do so, it needs specific information to be stored by AggregateRequest nodes. Part of that information could not be found. \n\nEnsure that the message flow is correctly designed for aggregation. In particular, verify that Output nodes come before AggregateRequest nodes and that the Environment of the message tree is not changed by the flow after the AggregateControl node. 

4435: BIP4435E: \
The Aggregation Reply node has received a reply message which has a blank reply ID: {0}. \n\nThis is not allowed because the reply ID is needed so that a reply message can be matched to the original request message. If you are using WebSphere MQ to send and receive aggregation requests, the reply ID must be stored in the correlation identifier (CorrelId) field of the message descriptor (MQMD) and it must be set to the value of the message ID in the request message''s MQMD. \n\nMake sure that all reply messages have their reply IDs correctly set to match the ID of the request message. 

4415: BIP4415E: \
The record of the request that initiated this reply contains unexpected data. \n\nAn AggregateReply node received unexpected information when dealing with the record of the request that was stored to correlate against this reply. \n\nContact your IBM support center.

Failed to get a message from queue ''{0}''. \n\nCheck that the underlying aggregation WebSphere MQ queue is functioning correctly. 

4403: BIP4403E: \
The control terminal is not connected. \n\nThe control terminal on the AggregateControl node is not connected to any other nodes. \n\nCheck the message flow and ensure that the control terminal on the AggregateControl node is ultimately connected to the control terminal on the corresponding AggregateReply node. This is to ensure control messages from the AggregateControl node reach the AggregateReply node. 

4436: BIP4436E: \
Unable to backout a timeout message to ''{0}'' after processing ''{1}'' times. Error text: {2}. \n\nAn AggregateReply node detected that a timeout message had been processed {1} times. The backout threshold is set on the Aggregation queues, so backout processing was attempted. \n\nThe AggregateReply node attempts to put this message back on the dead-letter queue. If the dead-letter queue is not defined, the timeout message is discarded, but user data on the reply queue will not be affected. 

4419: BIP4419E: \
Invalid reply message received by AggregateReply node ''{1}''. Missing Information : ''{0}'' \n\nAn AggregateReply node received a message at its in terminal. The message was not in the format that was expected. The following information was expected but not found: ''{0}'' \n\nEnsure that the message received at the control terminal of the AggregateReply node has a ''Properties'' folder. 

4420: BIP4420E: \
Request message identifier is not unique \n\nThe AggregateRequest node ''{0}'' attempted to record the delivery of a request message, but the message''s unique identifier has already been used. \n\nEnsure that a new unique identifier is generated for the request message you are passing to the AggregateRequest node. This can be achieved by using the ''Request'' tab when configuring the MQOutput node or the MQeOutput node. Check that the same message is not being propagated to more than one AggregateRequest node.

A parser for the message domain ''{0}'' is trying to use an invalid message model ''{1}''. The message model ''{1}'' is invalid because it specifies a message model for the same shared library ''{2}'' that contains the node that created the parser. \n\nShared libraries cannot explicitly refer to themselves. \n\nThe invalid message model might be set as a property on a node, as the value of the ''MessageSet'' element in the ''Properties'' tree, or as a method parameter in custom ESQL, Java or .NET transformation code.  \nIf you want to use the message model for the shared library that contains the node that created the parser, then do not specify a message model.  \nWhen no message model is specified, the message model for the container that owns the current message flow or subflow is used. 

1339: BIP1339E: \
Siebel node ''{0}'', in subflow ''{1}'', cannot be deployed in shared library ''{2}''. \n\nSiebelInput and SiebelRequest nodes are not supported in shared libraries. \n\nRemove all SiebelInput and SiebelRequest nodes from all subflows in the specified shared library. 

1928: BIP1928E: \
The installed extension ''{0}'' cannot be removed. The error is: ''{1}''. 

1317: BIP1317E: \
The node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' cannot be deployed because it specifies the message domain ''{2}'' and an invalid message model ''{3}''. The message model ''{3}'' is invalid because it specifies a message model for the same shared library ''{4}'' that contains the node. \n\nShared libraries cannot explicitly refer to themselves. \n\nWhen you configure a node in a shared library to use resources in that same library, do not specify the name of the shared library.

1147: BIP1147E: \
The BAR file ''{0}'' could not be written. \n\nThe system tried to update the BAR file, but could not write to the bar file. This might be because the file, if it already exists, is read-only, or because the file system is write-protected. \n\nEnsure that the bar file can be written to, and reissue the command.

Check also that the HTTP listener that is used for the web administration port is running by searching for BIP3132 in the integration node system log. 

1301: BIP1301E: \
The application ''{0}'' cannot be deployed because it depends on the shared library ''{1}'', which is not deployed to the integration server. \n\nDeploy the shared library ''{1}'' to the integration server. Alternatively, remove the dependency on the shared library ''{1}'' from the application ''{0}''.

Starts message flows. \n\nSyntax:  \n mqsistartmsgflow integrationNodeSpec (-g | -e integrationServerName) [[(-k applicationName | -z)] [-y staticLibraryName] (-m flowName | -j)] [-w timeoutSecs] [-v traceFileName]  \n  \n Command options:  \n ''integrationNodeSpec'' is one of:  \n   (a) ''integrationNodeName'' : Name of a locally defined integration node  \n   (b) ''-n integrationNodeFileName'' : File containing remote integration node connection parameters (*.broker)  \n   (c) ''[integrationNodeName] -i ipAddress -p port'' : hostname and port of a remote integration node. ''integrationNodeName'' optional for validation.  \n   (d) ''[integrationNodeName] -i uri'' : URI for the remote integration node in the form tcp://[<user>[:<password>]@]<host>:<port>  \n                               If a user name and password are supplied, any URI Reserved characters in the password must be percent-encoded.  \n ''-g'' all integration servers.  \n ''-e integrationServerName'' name of the integration server on which to start message flows. If this is not specified, all integration server processes are started.  \n ''-z'' starts all applications on the specified integration node or integration server  \n ''-k applicationName'' the name of the application to start or the name of the application that contains the message flow.  \n ''-y staticLibraryName'' the name of the static library that contains the message flow.  \n ''-m flowName'' the name of the message flow to start  \n ''-j'' starts all message flows on the specified integration node or integration server  \n ''-w timeoutSecs'' maximum number of seconds to wait for each object to start (default is 60)  \n ''-v traceFileName'' send verbose internal trace to the specified file.  \n \n Note: If -e or -g is specified without -m or -j then the start will only apply to integration servers. The saved run state of the message flow will be honoured on restart. Those that were in stopped state will remain in stopped state. Those that were in running state will be restarted.  \n Note: If -e is specified with -m or -j the integration server needs to be in running state. If the named integration server is in stopped state, the command will be rejected.  \n Note: Similar behavior will be observed with -g combined with -m or -j, in that if a stopped integration server is encountered then the start message flow request will not be processed. However, processing will continue until the command has been attempted on each integration server.  \n Note: When an integration server is in stopped state it is not possible to start or stop the message flows within it. An integration server needs to be in running state to process the start or stop message flow request, and so the only command a stopped integration server will accept is the request to start the integration server itself. 

1346: BIP1346E: \
The IDL file ''{0}'' cannot be deployed in shared library ''{1}''. \n\nIDL files are not supported in shared libraries. \n\nRemove all IDL files from the specified shared library.

Check that the specified TCP/IP address matches the address of the machine where the integration node is running, and that the specified port matches the web administration port that is configured for the integration node. \n\nThe utility encountered a problem while attempting to connect to the integration node. \n\nCheck that the integration node is running. The connection to the integration node requires that the HTTP listener that is used by the integration node is running. Check that the HTTP listener is running by searching for BIP3132 in the integration node system log.

Application ''{0}'' references shared library ''{1}''. 

1144: BIP1144W: \
Ignoring property override ''{0}'' in ''{1}'' \n\nThe property override ''{0}'' was ignored because it does not correspond to an existing property value that can be replaced, nor is it in the correct format for a property identifier. \n\nIf the override was intended to be a property identifier, ensure that the format of the identifier is ''flow#node.property'' or ''flow#property''. Use the mqsireadbar command to list the property names that can be overridden in a specific BAR file. . If the override was intended to be a an existing property value, ensure that the property value is currently set in the deployment descriptor. If the value exists in the deployment descriptor, it may not have been found because it had already been set to something else earlier in the override processing. For example, if using mqsiapplybaroverride with both the -p and -m flags set, note that overrides specified through -p are made before overrides specified through -m. This means that the manual overrides will be made to a deployment descriptor that has already had any substitutions from the overrides file made. . If you are seeing this error message on the z/OS platform and are using an XML-based overrides file, ensure that the correct encoding is specified in the XML header.

Stops message flows. \n\nSyntax:  \n mqsistopmsgflow integrationNodeSpec (-g | -e integrationServerName) [[(-k applicationName | -z)] [-y staticLibraryName] (-m flowName | -j)] [-w timeoutSecs] [-v traceFileName] [-f forceMode]  \n  \n Command options:  \n ''integrationNodeSpec'' is one of:  \n   (a) ''integrationNodeName'' : Name of a locally defined integration node  \n   (b) ''-n integrationNodeFileName'' : File containing remote integration node connection parameters (*.broker)  \n   (c) ''[integrationNodeName] -i ipAddress -p port'' : hostname and port of a remote integration node. ''integrationNodeName'' optional for validation.  \n   (d) ''[integrationNodeName] -i uri'' : URI for the remote integration node in the form tcp://[<user>[:<password>]@]<host>:<port>  \n                               If a user name and password are supplied, any URI Reserved characters in the password must be percent-encoded.  \n ''-g'' all integration servers.  \n ''-e integrationServerName'' name of the integration server on which to stop message flows. If this is not specified, all integration servers on the integration node are stopped.  \n ''-z'' stops all applications on the specified integration node or integration server  \n ''-k applicationName'' the name of the application to stop or the name of the application that contains the message flow.  \n ''-y staticLibraryName'' the name of the static library that contains the message flow.  \n ''-m flowName'' the name of the message flow to stop  \n ''-j'' stops all message flows on the specified integration node or integration server but leaves integration server processes running  \n ''-w timeoutSecs'' maximum number of seconds to wait for message flows to stop (default is 60)  \n ''-v traceFileName'' send verbose internal trace to the specified file  \n ''-f forceMode'' causes the stop to be enforced using the forceMode parameter. A value of ''normal'' causes the stop without forcing any threads to stop and a value of ''restartExecutionGroup'' stops the flow by restarting the integration server process.  \n Note: If -e or -g is specified without -m or -j then the stop will only apply to integration servers. The current run state of the message flow will be saved ready for restart.  \n Note: When an integration server is in stopped state it is not possible to start or stop the message flows within it. An integration server needs to be in running state to process the start or stop message flow request, and so the only command a stopped integration server will accept is the request to start the integration server itself.

4272: BIP4272E: \
An element error occurred. \n\nThe node ImbDebugNode was unsuccessful in extracting an element value. \n\nRestart your integration node, redeploy the message flow and retry the operation. If this problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

6082: BIP6082E: \
Invalid target element. Type = ''{0}'', Name = ''{1}'', value = ''{2}''. \n\nThe target element of a folder bit-stream operation must be a name element and may not have a value. The supplied target did not meet this requirement. \n\nEnsure that the field reference used to identify the target element correctly addresses a name element. 

4629: BIP4629I: \
Timeout request being processed by node ''{1}'' \n\nA TimeoutNotification node is processing a timeout with identifier ''{0}'' \n\nNo user action required 

4761: BIP4761E: \
The message flow attempted to use ''{0}'' configurable service ''{1}'', which has not been defined in the integration node. \n\nConfigurable services need to be set on the integration node. Use the mqsireportproperties command to check that a ''''{0}'' configurable service called ''{1} exists. \n\nUse the mqsicreateconfigurableservice command to create the required configurable service. 

3934: BIP3934E: \
The field reference ''{0}'' could not be used to retrieve a field from result message. \n\nThe result data location on the node could not be used to find a field in the result message. The most likely cause is that the field does not exist. \n\nReview the result data location property on the node and make sure that it points to a valid location in the result tree. 

7999: BIP7999I: \
Failed to connect to the Integration Registry. See previous errors for the reason why. \n\nThe Integration Registry is not accessable or is invalid. All policy function will be disabled in the integration server. \n\nCorrect the reported issue and restart the integration node. 

3341: BIP3341E: \
File node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' could not rename file ''{2}'' because another thread is using it. \n\nThe flow is unable to continue processing because the file is in use. The node waited for 1 second for the file to become free, but the file remained in use. The file node needed to rename the file, but another thread in the integration server containing the flow is using the file. This other thread could be an additional instance of the flow, or a different flow that uses the same file. \n\nIf no other flows in the same integration server are accessing the file, reducing or eliminating additional instances for this flow may prevent file contention, at the cost of reduced throughput.  \nIf other flows or instances are likely to contend for access to the file, it may help to set the Retry options on the flow''s input node to allow multiple attempts. 

6245: BIP6245E: \
Error in node: {0}. A problem was encountered inserting parameter values into prepared statement: {1}. \n\nThe node was unable to insert a value for parameter ''{2}'' into the prepared statement. It is not possible to use a parameter value acquired from an integration node tree element that does not have a valid value state. The value state of the element is ''{3}''. \n\nContact your IBM Integration Bus administrator. 

2703: BIP2703W: \
The identity token type ''{0}'', issued by ''{2}'', was not authorized by security provider ''{3}'' to access message flow ''{4}''. (For a ''username'' token type, the token is: ''{1}''.) \n\nIf access is expected, ensure that the specified security provider has been configured to allow access to the specified message flow. If the security provider is shown as ''Cached'', the authorization result is now being returned from the integration node security cache. You can use the ''mqsireloadsecurity'' command to clear the integration node security cache. Check your security provider logs for information about why the identity token could not be authorized. 

4912: BIP4912E: \
The Operation name property has been configured incorrectly for CORBARequest node ''{0}''. \n\nThe Operation name property for the node ''{0}'' has been set to a null value or an empty string and is therefore not valid. \n\nThe operation name can be configured by using a property on the node or in the local environment.  If the name is set in both places, the local environment takes precedence over the node property. 

5811: BIP5811E: \
The DFDL parser signalled that a validation error occurred when processing a DFDL message.  The message from the DFDL parser is:  {0} \n\nA DFDL validation error occurred during the parsing of a DFDL message. \n\nReview and resolve the problems indicated in the message from the DFDL parser. 

3972: BIP3972E: \
A Database Policy error was issued because the input into the database column ''{0}'' is nil. \n\nThis error was configured via the Database Policy to be issued by the mapping node when it detected a nil input. Additional diagnostic information might be written to the user trace. \n\nInspect the diagnostic information, and check the user trace for further information. 

3306: BIP3306E: \
 FileInput node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' is unable to process file ''{2}''. The absolute path of file ''{2}'' exceeds the system limit for some systems, which is ''{3}'' for path length. The FileInput node is now blocked, and will not pickup further files until this file is removed. \n\n The FileInput node is unable to pickup the file due to the absolute path of the file name exceeding system limits. The FileInput node is now blocked, and will not pickup further files until this file is removed. \n\n Reduce the length of the file name, or reduce the length of the absolute path, so that it is within acceptable limits. 

2146: BIP2146E: \
A required property ''{0}'' was not specified in the DataCapture API request. \n\nA DataCapture API request was made which requires a mandatory parameter ''{0}'' which was not provided.

The DecisionService node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' cannot locate the ruleset ''{4}'' in the remote repository that is defined by the DecisionServiceRepository configurable service. \n\nThe DecisionService node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' (application ''{2}'', library ''{3}'') is configured to use a DecisionServiceRepository configurable service. The ruleset ''{4}'' with namespace ''{5}'' cannot be located in the remote decision service repository as defined by the configurable service. \n\nCheck that the DecisionServiceRepository configurable service properties are correct. Check that the JDBCProviders configurable service properties are correct. Check that the ruleset ''{4}'' with namespace ''{5}'' is deployed to the remote repository. If you are using a decision service deployed to the integration server, do not select the option "Use DecisionServiceRepository configurable service". Check that the decision service is deployed to the integration server. 

4696: BIP4696E: \
The JMSInput Node ''{0}'' could not backout a message. \n\nNode ''{0}'' has been unable to backout a message. The node was unable to obtain a MessageProducer for the backout destination ''{1}''. The JMS Client did not return any error information. \n\nExamine the logs for your JMS Provider to determine why a MessageProducer could not be created.  Correct this situation if possible. 

4685: BIP4685E: \
An error occurred closing a JMS session for the provider with Initial Context Factory ''{0}''. \n\nThe underlying JMS connection with the JMS provider has probably failed. \n\nCheck the connectivity and availability of the JMS provider. 

4862: BIP4862E: \
The IBM Integration Bus sequence event store failed to process a storage request when it attempted to store the event on WebSphere MQ queue ''{0}''. \n\nReview the previous exception to establish the cause of the error. 

3327: BIP3327I: \
File node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' will delete file ''{2}'' from directory ''{3}''. \n\nThe FileOutput node will delete a file from a directory because a new file of the same name is to be created there. \n\nNo user action is required.

Generic expression: XPath expressions do not require message objects assigned as variable values. \n\nAn attempt was made to assign a message to a variable name, in node ''{0}''. \n\nNone. 

7158: BIP7158E: \
The policy in the policy file ''{0}'', specified for the cache manager, is invalid.  The integration node, with name ''{1}'' and listener hosts ''{2}'', specifies an invalid port range of ''{3}''.  This port range conflicts with that of the integration node with name ''{4}'' and listener hosts ''{5}'', which uses the port range ''{6}''.  The integration node configuration has not been changed. \n\nIt is invalid to define overlapping port ranges for integration nodes on a single listener host. \n\nAlter the port range for either of the integration nodes specified so that the port ranges do not conflict with each other. 

3325: BIP3325E: \
File node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' cannot use the directory ''{2}'' for file name ''{3}''. \n\nThe file node cannot create the directory or cannot move a file into or out of the directory with that name. \n\nEnsure that the file and directory names are correctly specified in the message flow. The names may contain invalid characters or the directory may be ineligible for use, or the integration node may not have the authority to perform the action required. See the IBM Integration Bus online documentation sections "FileInput node" and "FileOutput node" for more information. 

3933: BIP3933E: \
The CICSConnection configurable service ''{1}'' gatewayURL property contains an invalid CICS Transaction Gateway URL ''{0}''. \n\nThe CICSConnection configurable service ''{1}'' gatewayURL property must contain a valid CICS Transaction Gateway URL value. The URL must be made up of the structure [protocol]://[hostname]:[port]. Where ''protocol'' can be either ''tcp'' or ''ssl'', ''hostname'' must be the IPv4 TCP/IP address or DNS-resolvable hostname of the CICS Transaction Gateway daemon process, and ''port'' is the port number of the protocol listener in CICS Transaction Gateway. \n\nCorrect the CICSConnection configurable service gatewayURL property. 

4665: BIP4665E: \
JMSClient.''{0}''.The node could not update MRM-related property values in the MbMessage. \n\nThe node could not set values for message set, type, or format in the MbMessage. \n\nIf possible, turn on service trace and investigate the format of the data in the JMSType field in the header data of the JMS message. 

2140: BIP2140I: \
Message injection is disabled for integration server - ''{0}''. \n\nMessage injection is disabled for this integration server. Please enable message injection and retry the operation. 

3966: BIP3966I: \
The Mapping node has evaluated the condition predicate ''{0}'' to be ''true''. The Mapping node will now step into this ''if'' transform. \n\nThe Mapping node is about to process the nested transforms in this ''if'' block. \n\nCheck the following messages to see the progression of the mapping process.

2760: BIP2760E: \
The business event with msgkey {0} which was emitted from {1} could not be recorded as part of a business transaction because it did not contain a global ID. \n\nThe global ID for an event is used to correlate all events that make up a business transaction. If the global ID is missing, the event can not be correlated with other events for any business transactions. Each event that is flagged for a business transaction must have a global ID configured for it. \n\nEnsure that the evaluated global ID is not empty. 

6096: BIP6096E: \
Generic expression: ESQL expressions do not require XPath value objects assigned as variable values. \n\nAn attempt was made to assign an XPath value to a variable name, in node ''{0}''. \n\nNone. 

3935: BIP3935I: \
The integration node evaluated expression ''{0}'' against the current record to decide whether to propagate the record. The result was ''{1}''. \n\nIf the result is true, the record is propagated to the rest of the flow. Otherwise, it is ignored. \n\nNone 

3366: BIP3366E: \
 Failed to create queues that are needed by agent ''{0}''. To create the queues manually, run the runmqsc script ''{2}'' on the integration node queue manager ''{1}''. \n\nSome queues that are needed to initialize the agent do not exist. The queues cannot be created, perhaps because of a lack of authority to create queues from within the integration node integration server, or the runmqsc command not being available. \n\nCreate the queues manually, either by running the above script on the integration node queue manager, or by using the MQ explorer tool. 

4833: BIP4833E: \
The Sequence node ''{0}'' encountered an invalid (non-integer) start sequence number (''{1}'') in the default local environment path, for sequence group ''{2}''. \n\nThe Sequence node ''{0}'' has received a message, but the start sequence number set in the local environment does not contain a valid integer value. The message has been rejected from the sequence group ''{2}''. The invalid element value is ''{1}''. \n\nEnsure that the start sequence number set in the local environment is an integer. 

2715: BIP2715W: \

2250: BIP2250W: \
Request to delete connection between node uuid=''{0}'' (label unknown) terminal ''{1}'', and node ''{3}'' (uuid=''{2}'') terminal ''{4}'': source does not exist in message flow ''{5}''. \n\nThe integration node received a configuration message containing an instruction to delete a connection between two node terminals, but the source node could not be found in the message flow. \n\nEnsure that the message flow, and any nested message flows have been saved.  Redeploy the new configuration to the integration node ensuring that the complete configuration option is used. If the problem persists contact your IBM support center. 

5806: BIP5806E: \
The DFDL serializer signalled that an internal error occurred.  The message from the DFDL serializer is:  {0} \n\nErrors have occurred during the serializing of a DFDL message tree. \n\nReview further error messages for an indication to the cause of the errors. If you are unable to find the cause, contact your IBM support center. 

2759: BIP2759E: \
The integration server is configured to record data for the data capture policy ''{0}'', but either WebSphere MQ is not available on this platform, or there is no queue manager associated with the integration node. \n\nYou must associate a queue manager with the integration node in order to record data for the specified data capture policy. \n\nNo user response is required. 

2297: BIP2297I: \
Integration Server service trace has been enabled due to user-initiated action. \n\nIntegration Server service trace has been enabled due to an action initiated from either the command line or a GUI action. \n\nNo user action required. 

2398: BIP2398E: \
A failure occurred during the process of committing or rolling back a database transaction, therefore the integration server will be restarted. \n\nA failure occurred when a database transaction was being committed or rolled back. The integration server is now in an undefined state and must be restarted. \n\nCheck the database completion and reason codes to establish the cause of the error, taking appropriate action. You might need to restart the integration node after you have completed this recovery action. 

7982: BIP7982E: \
 Notification threshold value of ''{0}'' is invalid. \n\nAn attempt was made to change the value of a message flow property, called ''{2}'', from ''{1}'' to ''{0}''. The value must be a valid integer that is equal to or greater than 0. \n\nEnsure the value being set is a valid integer that is equal to or greater than 0. 

4372: BIP4372S: \
Failure to locate Java method or field {0} in class {1}. \n\nThe Java method or field {0} in class {1} could not be found by the Java API framework. \n\nThis is an internal error. Contact your IBM support center. 

3938: BIP3938E: \
An attempt was made to access the file ''{0}'', but it has already been opened by the FileRead ''{1}'' node. \n\nBy default, when a FileRead node reads data from a file, it reads it in a streaming mode. Data is not read from the file until it is requested to by the parser. This error might occur in a node, for example, an MQOutput or Compute node, that is after the original FileRead node in the message flow. This error might also occur if an attempt is made to access data in the file and the file being used is deleted or archived by another FileRead node, or by an external process. For example, if one FileRead node reads data followed by another FileRead node archiving the file, and if the message is not fully parsed by the time the second FileRead node is reached, then a following MQOutput node can cause this error. \n\nEnsure the parser is not required to access the file after it has been deleted. This can be done by either configuring the &quot;Parse timing&quot; property in the Parser Options tab in the original FileRead node to &quot;Immediate&quot, so that the message is fully parsed before leaving the node; or ensuring that the message tree is not accessed after the file has been deleted (any copies of the tree can be accessed). 

4351: BIP4351E: \
An error has occurred in the debugger''s Remote Agent Controller \n\nThe Remote Agent Controller is a separate process used to debug the integration node. \n\nObserve any following errors and try to correct them. If you are unable to do so, please contact your IBM support center. 

2179: BIP2179E: \
Failed to convert an ImbWstring to an ImbUuidValue (Error code = ''{0}''). \n\nThe system could not convert the input ImbWstring to an ImbUuidValue. \n\nMake sure the input is valid. 

4617: BIP4617E: \
The TimeoutNotification node ''{1}'' failed to access its internal store on queue ''{0}''. \n\nThe node could not access its internal store because the WebSphere MQ operation failed. \n\nCorrect the cause of the WebSphere MQ failure. 

6250: BIP6250E: \
Error in node: {0}. A problem was encountered evaluating the result set from prepared statement: {1}, which was given for the ''{2}'' data element expression in the data element table for this node. \n\nThe node evaluated the result set for column ''{2}'', for data element table row entry ''{3}''. A value was expected, but none was found for this column in the set. \n\nExamine the provided prepared statement to confirm that it is correct. 

4515: BIP4515E: \
A shared URL classloader attempted to load a jar file from the directory ''{0}'', but the directory does not exist. \n\nThe shared URL classloader attempts to load all jar files in a given directory, but the directory does not exist. This will not directly cause any failures, but it might cause a class not found exception if a node was relying on a jar file which should be in that directory. \n\nMake sure the directory exists and contains any required jar files. 

9303: BIP9303E: \
Invalid policy descriptor for the policy type ''{0}''. \n\nPolicy document can not be validated as the policy descriptor does not contain the required element ''{1}''. \n\nRecord the full details provided with this message and contact your IBM Support Center. 

4628: BIP4628I: \

5702: BIP5702E: \
A JSON parsing error occurred. The end of the bit stream was reached before the message was complete.  The JSON parser was expecting to find one of the following characters or types: {1}  The internal error code is {0}. \n\nThis error was reported by the JSON parser, and is typically the result of a truncated JSON message. \n\nAnother possible cause is that a string in the message data has not been closed correctly.  \nEnsure that all the strings in the message have been closed. 

2253: BIP2253W: \
Request to delete connection between node ''{1}'' (uuid=''{0}'') terminal ''{2}'', and node ''{4}'' (uuid=''{3}'') terminal ''{5}'': target terminal does not exist in message flow ''{6}''. \n\nThe integration node received a configuration message containing an instruction to delete a connection between two node terminals, but the target terminal could not be found in the message flow. \n\nEnsure that the message flow, and any nested message flows have been saved.  Redeploy the new configuration to the integration node ensuring that the complete configuration option is used. If the problem persists contact your IBM support center. 

3947: BIP3947E: \
The map processing for QName ''{0}'' has failed, with the following details: ''{1}''. \n\nThe processing of the map has failed. \n\nReview and resolve the problems indicated in the message from the map processing. 

6066: BIP6066E: \
The ''{0}'' parser could not parse the bitstream into a sequence of records. This type of parser does not support the Parsed Record Sequence option for the Record Detection parameter. \n\nIn a FileInput node, the Record Detection parameter was set to Parsed Record Sequence on the Records and Elements tab so that the node propagates each matching structure as a separate message.  \nThe message domain selected on the Inbound Message Parsing tab does not support this option. This option is only supported with the XMLNSC, JSON, MRM TDS and MRM CWF parsers. \n\nTo avoid this problem, do one of the following:  \nModify the Record Detection parameter on the Records and Elements tab so that the parser selected on the Inbound Message Parsing tab can be used.  \nModify the Message domain parameter on the Inbound Message Parsing tab so that the XMLNSC, JSON, MRM TDS or MRM CWF parser is used. 

5705: BIP5705E: \
JSON parsing errors have occurred. \n\nErrors have occurred during parsing of JSON. \n\nReview further error messages for an indication to the cause of the errors. 

3364: BIP3364E: \
WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition agent ''{0}'' has stopped because of ''{1}''.  The exception message was ''{2}''. Check the FTE log for more information ''{3}''. \n\nThe WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition agent has stopped because of an exception. 

3087: BIP3087E: \
Error message ''{0}'' from trace node ''{1}''. \n\nThe trace node ''{1}'' has output the specified error message. \n\nThis is an error message provided by the message flow designer.  The user response will be determined by the local environment. 

4062: BIP4062E: \
Node (class={0} name={1}) did not specify a closing brace in pattern attribute. \n\nA Trace node in a message flow included an expression within a ''pattern'' attribute. However, the expression was not terminated with a closing brace character. \n\nCorrect the message flow configuration and redeploy the integration node. 

2156: BIP2156E: \
Web user interface did not initialize because the listening port ''{0}'' could not be started. \n\nThe web user interface attempted to start, but the HTTP listener ''{0}'' could not be started.  It is likely that another integration node has already created a listener on this port.  You can change the port number for the web user interface by using the IBM Integration Toolkit or the command ''mqsichangeproperties [integrationNodeName] -b webadmin -o HTTP[S]Connector -n port -v [new port]'' \n\nCheck that the port is not already in use and that the user ID under which IBM Integration Bus is running has the necessary permission to open that port. 

2701: BIP2701W: \
The user ID ''{0}'' has been truncated to 12 characters. \n\nThe user ID ''{0}'' is too long to fit into the MQMD.UserIdentifier field, and was truncated to 12 characters. \n\nSpecify a new user ID that is 12 characters or less. 

5742: BIP5742E: \
The JSON file ''{0}'' in static library ''{1}'' cannot be deployed because it contains invalid JSON data. \n\nJSON files in static libraries must contain valid JSON data. \n\nCheck the following error messages for a description of the JSON parsing error. Modify the static library ''{1}'' so that all of its JSON files contain valid JSON data. 

4892: BIP4892I: \
CORBARequest node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' in integration server ''{2}'' has called operation ''{4}'' from interface ''{3}'' on object reference ''{5}''. \n\nThe CORBARequest node has made a call to CORBA. \n\nNone. 

2242: BIP2242E: \
Message flow ''{1}'' could not be reconfigured because it remained busy for longer than the timeout period of ''{0}'' \n\nA request to reconfigure the message flow ''{1}'' was received but this could not be processed because it remained busy processing a message for longer than the timeout specified. \n\nThis can be caused by the timeout being too short considering the complexity of the flow and the size of the messages being processed. In such cases the timeout should be increased. It can also be caused by message flows containing infinite loops. In such cases the SQL should be corrected. 

2348: BIP2348E: \
Error detected while attempting to obtain a connection to data source ''{0}'' of type ''{1}'' using userid ''{2}''. \n\nThe integration node detected an error while attempting to obtain a connection to data source ''{0}'' of type ''{1}'' with userid ''{2}''. If your integration node is running on z/OS, it is possible for the userid to be blank, which results in a connection attempt using the userid of the started task. \n\nSee the following messages for details of the error, or use the mqsicvp command to verify the database configuration. 

7132: BIP7132E: \
The ''listenerHost'' property of the integration node-level cache manager cannot be set to the value ''{0}'', because the property contains multiple listener hosts.  The integration node-level cache manager configuration has not been changed. \n\nMultiple listener hosts cannot be specified for the ''listenerHost'' property of the integration node-level cache manager.  \nIf multiple listener hosts are required for this integration node, then those listener hosts must be listed in an integration node-level cache manager policy file. The ''listenerHost'' property of the integration node-level cache manager must then match one of the listener hosts specified for this integration node in the policy file. \n\nChange the value specified for the ''listenerHost'' property of the integration node-level cache manager so that it contains only one listener host. 

4510: BIP4510E: \
Java compute class ''{0}'' not found. \n\nThe class ''{0}'' associated with Java compute node ''{1}'' could not be found by the integration node. \n\nEnsure that the class ''{0}'' has been deployed and is available to the integration node.

The cause might be because the CICS region is not available, or because the SSL configuration is not correct.  The CICSRequest node does not support a separate SSL truststore, which means that any signer certificates required for CICS connectivity must be placed in the keystore file instead of in a separate truststore file.  For more information, see "Securing the connection to CICS by using SSL" in the IBM Integration Bus documentation. \n\nEnsure that the keystore file that is defined to the integration node contains the signer certificates, and if client-authentication is enabled in the TCPIPSERVICE, the integration node keystore file contains a personal certificate that is trusted by CICS. Also ensure that the CICS region is available, TCP/IP is enabled, and the TCPIPSERVICE that is defined in CICS is correctly configured for SSL.

This has caused DFDL validation to stop. \n\nReview further error messages in the event log, syslog or user trace for an indication of the cause of the errors. 

6249: BIP6249E: \
Error in node: {0}. A problem was encountered evaluating read-write path expression ''{1}'', which was given for the ''{2}'' data element expression in the data element table for this node. \n\nThe node evaluated the provided expression against the outgoing message tree, but the result of the expression has returned an element list where the first element is null. A single element value was expected to be returned. \n\nExamine the provided expression to confirm that it is correct. 

4371: BIP4371S: \
Failure to locate Java class {0} \n\nThe Java class {0} could not be found by the Java API framework. \n\nThis is an internal error. Contact your IBM support center. 

2222: BIP2222E: \
Invalid state: no records found for resource ''{0}'', ''{1}''. \n\nThe integration node could not locate records for the resource ''{0}'', ''{1}'' within its configuration store. The active state of the integration node might not be as expected. \n\nCheck for previous errors in the system event log, which might describe the cause of failure. Redeploying the complete integration node configuration by using the Integration Toolkit, the mqsideploy command, or the integration node Administration API, might solve the problem. If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

2303: BIP2303W: \
File ''{0}'' could not be unloaded; operating system return code ''{1}''. \n\nThe integration node detected the loadable implementation library ''{0}'' but this could not be unloaded by the operating system. The operating system return code was ''{1}''. \n\nContact either the author or the supplier of the loadable implementation library for further assistance.  If the supplier is IBM, contact your IBM support center. 

2261: BIP2261E: \
Node class name ''{0}'' for use in library ''{1}'' already registered in library ''{2}''. \n\nThe integration node detected the node factory in loadable implementation library ''{1}'' attempting to register the node class name ''{0}'', but this name has already been registered with the integration node by the node factory in the library ''{2}''. \n\nIf the two loadable implementation libraries are different instantiations of the same node, then remove one of the two from the ''bin'' directory for the integration node.  If the two loadable implementation libraries are for different nodes, then contact the author or supplier of the nodes and request that one changes the registered node class name. 

5718: BIP5718E: \
A JSON parsing error occurred on line {0} column {1}. An invalid Unicode escape sequence (Unicode codepoint: {2}) was found in the input bit stream. \n\nThis error was reported by the JSON parser, and is usually the result of a badly formed JSON message. \n\nOther possible causes are:  \n1. The Unicode codepoint is not in the Basic Multilingual Plane.  \n2. The Unicode codepoint is part of a surrogate pair, and does not have a corresponding leading or trailing surrogate.  \n    Ensure that the surrogate pairs are encoded properly, for example - "\uD834\uDD1E" corresponds to U+1D11E.  \n3. The Unicode codepoint is defined to be a Unicode non-character, for example - U+FFFF.  \n4. The Coded Character Set ID that is defined in the message header does not reflect the contents of the instance message. 

2717: BIP2717E: \
A valid identity token could not be located in the body of the message on node ''{0}'' using path ''{1}''. \n\nThe path expression either does not evaluate to an element in the message, or the element is of the wrong type. \n\nCheck that the path expression returns a valid element on all incoming messages, and that a parser has been selected on the input node. (It is not possible to evaluate a path expression against a BLOB.) 

4837: BIP4837E: \

4508: BIP4508E: \
Unable to serialize Java exception ''{0}''. Exception ''{1}'' was thrown when serializing a Java exception. The Java stack trace is ''{2}''. \n\nBecause the serialization has failed, this exception is not available in preceding nodes in the flow. \n\nIf the exception being serialized is a user class, ensure that it can be serialized. 

4369: BIP4369E: \
A memory allocation error has occurred. \n\nThe Java API framework was unsuccessful in allocating memory. \n\nRestart you integration node and retry the operation. If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

3923: BIP3923I: \
Message flow ''{0}'' has failed and rolled back its unit of work.  The monitoring events included in the message flow unit of work will not be available. \n\nThe message flow''s transaction has been backed out. This includes any monitoring events coordinated with the message flow unit of work, unless the event was a transaction start event, which will be included in a separate unit of work used for events marked as independent. \n\nNo action is required. 

4518: BIP4518E: \
The application ''{0}'' cannot load a Java class from the JavaClassLoader configurable service ''{1}''. Java isolation is enabled on the application ''{0}''. If the specified Java class has been deployed as part of the application, the class is not visible to the JavaClassLoader configurable service. \n\nThe specified application has Java isolation enabled. Java classes that are deployed in applications that have Java isolation enabled are not visible to JavaClassLoader configurable services. \n\nJava isolation for applications is enabled by default when you package applications into BAR files by using Version 10.0 and later. You can use shared libraries instead of JavaClassLoader configurable services to share Java classes across multiple applications when those applications have Java isolation enabled.  \nTo use JavaClassLoader configurable services with Java classes that are deployed in an application, you must disable Java isolation for that application.  \nYou can disable Java isolation for an application by using the BAR file editor in the Integration Toolkit. Alternatively, you can use the ''mqsiapplybaroverrides'' command to modify the value of the ''javaIsolation'' property of the application. You must redeploy the application after you have disabled Java isolation. 

2216: BIP2216W: \
Node ''{3}'' could not use the value ''{1}'' from the LocalEnvironment for overriding property ''{0}''. The value is not valid; valid values are ''{2}''. \n\nThe value is not valid for that property. \n\nMake sure only one of the ''{2}'' values is used. 

4057: BIP4057I: \
The value of user-defined property ''{3}'' defined on message flow ''{2}'' (integration server ''{1}'' of integration node ''{0}'') has been changed from ''{4}'' to ''{5}''. \n\nA configuration request was received by the integration node to change the value of the user-defined property. \n\nNone. 

3333: BIP3333E: \
The File node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' cannot resolve the relative file path ''{2}''. \n\nRelative file paths are resolved by using the absolute directory path in the ''MQSI_FILENODES_ROOT_DIRECTORY'' environment variable.  \n This environment variable is not set correctly and cannot be used to resolve the path. \n\nEither ensure that the ''MQSI_FILENODES_ROOT_DIRECTORY'' environment variable contains an absolute directory path and that the directory exists and can be accessed by the integration node, or change the node configuration to use absolute directory paths.  \n See the IBM Integration Bus online documentation topic "FileInput node" or "FileOutput node" for more information. 

7195: BIP7195E: \
The policy in the policy file ''{0}'', specified for the cache manager, is invalid.  The integration node, with name ''{1}'' and listener host ''{2}'', is not defined in the policy.  The policy must include a definition for this integration node.  The integration node configuration has not been changed. \n\nEnsure that this integration node is defined in the policy.  \nIf the integration node is already defined, check that the name and listener host specified for this integration node match the name and listener host specified in the policy.

Use the reason identified in this message with the accompanying messages to determine the cause of the error. Use the mqsicvp command to test connectivity to this database. 

2323: BIP2323E: \
DBMS ''{0}'' is not supported for a coordinated transaction. \n\nA message flow has been configured for a globally coordinated transaction, and a message processing node has specified a database connection target as a participant in the global transaction. However, this DBMS is not supported by IBM Integration Bus as a participant in a globally coordinated transaction. The message flow is terminated and the input message is backed out. \n\nBecause this target DBMS is not supported as a participant in a coordinated transaction, the node can use this database only outside a global transaction. 

2236: BIP2236W: \
Product LIL directory ''{0}'' is not the first entry in LIL path ''{1}''. \n\nProduct LIL directory ''{0}'' is not the first entry in LIL path ''{1}''. This may interfere with core integration node functionality, and cause unexpected behavior during integration node operation. \n\nChange the integration node LIL path to include the product LIL directory as the first entry. 

4812: BIP4812I: \
Invoking the evaluate method on the PHP class ''{0}''. \n\nThe PHPCompute node is invoking the user''s evaluate method for the class ''{0}''. 

5802: BIP5802E: \
A unknown error occurred in the DFDL serializer.  The operation being attempted was: {0}. \n\nThe DFDL parser signalled that an operation had failed. An error description was not provided by the parser. \n\nThis is an internal error. Please contact your IBM support center.

This can be because another message flow has created this file but it has not yet been finished (it is still in the transit directory). The new file is not created and an exception is thrown. \n\nOutput files are written to the ''mqsitransit'' subdirectory of the output directory. If the file will not be finished (and moved to the output directory) by a subsequent flow then the file may need to be removed manually. Before handling files in the ''mqsitransit'' directory all flows which refer to its parent directory should be stopped. See the IBM Integration Bus online documentation section "FileOutput node" for more information.

4983: BIP4983W: \
 The FTE agent name is too long, and has been truncated from ''{0}'' to ''{1}''. \n\nThe FTE agent name is derived from a combination of the integration node and integration server name. If the integration node name exceeds 12 characters, or the integration server exceeds 15 characters, they are truncated to form the agent name. This might result in two integration servers running an agent with the same name. If this happens, behavior is undefined. Both agents start successfully, and try to register with the coordination queue manager, but only one is correctly registered. \n\nChange the name of the integration server containing the agent to be within the required size limit.

A JSON writing error occurred. No element named ''Data'' was found as a child of the root element. \n\nWhile writing the JSON message no element named ''Data'' was found as a child of the root element.  \nThere must be one, and only one element named ''Data'' as a child of the root element. \n\nCreate a child of the root element named ''Data''. 

7127: BIP7127E: \
The policy in the policy file ''{0}'', specified for the cache manager, is invalid.  The integration node, with name ''{1}'', defines a listener host ''{2}'' that appears to be a comma separated list of listener hosts.  Multiple listener hosts cannot be specified in a policy file using comma separated lists.  The integration node configuration has not been changed. \n\nAlter the relevant integration node so that multiple listener hosts are specified by using multiple ''listenerHost'' elements instead of using a comma separated list. 

4722: BIP4722E: \
Incorrect XPath expression ''{0}'' for the MQ property ''{1}'' in the MQHeader node ''{2}'' present in message flow ''{3}'' \n\nFor the element to which the XPath refers, no value could be found in the message, Environment, or LocalEnvironment. \n\nCheck that the XPath expression is correct and that a valid value is associated with the given element.

3373: BIP3373W: \
File node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}''. FTP server definition ''{2}'' contains an invalid cipher property. \n\nThe ciphers property is incorrectly specified on the FtpServer configurable service that was created with the ''mqsicreateconfigurableservice'' command. Valid values are lists containing any of the following: blowfish-cbc, 3des-cbc, aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc, aes256-cbc. Remote file transfer processing for this node has been disabled. \n\nEnsure that the FtpServer definition is correct, and that the cipher property is valid. Use the ''mqsichangeproperties'' command to alter a property of an FtpServer definition. If you adjust the FtpServer definition, restart the integration node to use the new values. The message flow FTP processing is enabled again when the message flow is restarted. For more information, see the "FtpServer configurable service properties" topic in the IBM Integration Bus information center. 

4651: BIP4651E: \
JMSClient. ''{0}'' A JMS exception occurred when the node tried to send a JMS message. If available the JMS exception text is : ''{1}'' \n\nThe node could not send a JMS message on the JMS session. The JMS provider returned an exception. \n\nInvestigate the cause of the JMS exception. If the problem persists, contact the vendor of the JMS provider. 

3316: BIP3316W: \
File node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' has no valid filename specified as property ''{2}''. \n\nThe FileOutput node file name property is either not specified or its value is not a valid file name. \n\nIf it is intended that each message has this property specified by the flow then there is no user action required. Otherwise ensure that the flow correctly sets the file name in the local environment prior to propagation to this FileOutput node, or set the node property to specify a valid filename. See the IBM Integration Bus online documentation section "FileOutput node" for more information. 

3338: BIP3338E: \
''{3}'' node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' could not open file ''{2}'' because another process has locked it. \n\nThe ''{3}'' node needed to open the file, but process other than the integration server containing the flow has a lock on the file. The flow is unable to continue processing the file, because it needs a read-write ("rw") lock. \n\nIf other processes are likely to contend for access to the file, it may help to set the Retry options on the flow''s input node to allow multiple attempts.  \nIf no other processes should be accessing the file, use your operating system''s facilities to identify the process holding the lock, and stop it or prevent it from running at the same time as the flow. 

4679: BIP4679I: \
An error has occurred in the message flow in JMSInput node ''{0}'', which is using the CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGMENT mode. This mode might cause ''{1}'' duplicate messages to be redelivered to the input node. \n\nThis error was detected by the JMSInput node. The node is configured to use JMS CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT mode, and an error has occurred during the acknowledgment of a batch of JMS messages. These messages have been processed by the message flow, but the JMS provider might redeliver them. This situation can also occur if the JMS connection being used by the node is broken and re-established. In both cases, duplicate messages might be received by the JMSInput node after the failure has occurred. \n\nIf the JMS provider supports the optional JMS redelivery count, you can set the JMSInput node Backout Threshold and Backout Destination properties to manage duplicate messages. If you prefer, you can define your own method to process duplicate messages. 

4354: BIP4354S: \

The RouteToLabel node cannot continue without at least one valid ''labelName'' element. \n\nEnsure that the local environment in the message contains at least one ''labelName'' element. The RouteToLabel node looks for a valid ''labelName'' element in the path: ''LocalEnvironment.Destination.RouterList.DestinationData.labelName''.  \nIf you have created the ''labelName'' element in the OutputLocalEnvironment of an ESQL Compute node, ensure that the ESQL Compute node has a compute mode setting that includes ''LocalEnvironment''. 

4373: BIP4373S: \
Element value type {0} is not valid. \n\nThe object supplied to MbElement.setValue(...) is not a supported type. \n\nContact the node provider for further details. 

3388: BIP3388W: \

5827: BIP5827E: \
The DFDL parser could not locate a message model for the application ''{0}''. \n\nThe DFDL parser is attempting to parse a DFDL message or a message tree, but a message model for the application ''{0}'' cannot be located. A message model for the application is built from all DFDL schemas in the application and its libraries when the application is deployed to the integration server. This situation can arise for one of the following reasons:  \n- No DFDL schemas exist in the application and its libraries.  \n- An error occurred during the preprocessing of the DFDL schemas in the application and its libraries. \n\nThe DFDL parser is attempting to parse a DFDL message or a message tree against a message model for the application ''{0}''. This parsing is being attempted because the following properties are not set or are set to a blank, and the message flow is running inside an application.  \n- In the ''Message Model'' property of an input node, a Validate node, or any other node that offers this property.  \n- In an MQRFH2 header  \n- In the SET parameter of the PARSE clause in an ESQL CREATE statement Ensure that the application and its libraries that provide the message model are deployed correctly. In order to use the message model from a shared library, ensure that the shared library is referenced by this application and that the properties above specify the shared library name. 

2211: BIP2211E: \
Invalid configuration message containing attribute value ''{1}'', which is not valid for target attribute ''{0}'', object ''{3}''; valid values are ''{2}''. \n\nThe integration node received a configuration message containing the attribute value ''{1}'', which is not valid for the target attribute ''{0}'', on object ''{3}''.  Valid values are ''{2}''. This can be caused by a mismatch in levels between the Integration Toolkit and the integration node. Or it can be caused as a result of a node defined by a user, or written by a third party, where the implementation library installed at the integration node does not match the node definition held at the Integration Toolkit. \n\nEnsure that the levels of code installed at the Integration Toolkit and integration node are consistent.  If they are, identify the supplier of the target object and report the problem to them.  If this is IBM, contact your IBM support center. 

2392: BIP2392E: \
DB2 wrapper (64-bit) could not find the function ''{0}'' in the DB2 implementation library ''{1}''. This function will not be available to integration node code in this process. \n\nThe ODBC driver manager has loaded the DB2 application binding library using a 64-bit DB2 wrapper, but the wrapper cannot find the function ''{0}'' which is needed for the integration node to operate completely correctly. Subsequent database errors may be caused by this problem. \n\nEnsure the DB2 wrapper library can find the correct DB2 application binding library. Setting MQSI_64BIT_DB2_LIBRARY_NAME to point to the correct libdb2.so (or .a on AIX) may help this problem. 

1984: BIP1984E: \
The integration server ''{0}'' failed to commit a configuration transaction whilst processing an administration request.

A Loadable Implementation Library (.lil, .jar, or .par) is not found for message flow node type ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}''. \n\nThe integration node received an instruction to create a message flow node of type ''{0}'', in message flow ''{1}''. The integration node cannot create nodes of this type because an implementation library for this node type does not exist in the LIL path. \n\nEnsure that the LIL path is correct, and that it contains all the required node implementation libraries, including those supplied by IBM. The node name is case sensitive, therefore check that the toolkit and runtime names match. If the integration node is trying to create a node type that ends in ''NodeNode'', ensure that when the node was registered with the toolkit the name registered did not end in ''Node''.  \nAlso ensure that you have saved the message flow, and any nested message flows. Redeploy the new configuration to the integration node, specifying a complete configuration. If the LIL file is correct, check that the message node type is correct. 

7198: BIP7198E: \

The DFDL parser could not locate a message for the integration server. \n\nThe DFDL parser is attempting to parse a DFDL message or a message tree, but a message model for the integration server cannot be located. A message model for the integration server is built from all DFDL schemas in any libraries deployed to the integration server. This situation can arise for one of the following reasons:  \n- No DFDL schemas exist in any libraries that are deployed to the integration server.  \n- An error occurred during the preprocessing of the DFDL schemas in the libraries. \n\nThe DFDL parser is attempting to parse a DFDL message or a message tree against a message model for the integration server. This parsing is being attempted because the following properties are not set or are set to a blank, and the message flow is running outside an application.  \n- In the ''Message Model'' property of an input node, a Validate node, or any other node that offers this property.  \n- In an MQRFH2 header  \n- In the SET parameter of the PARSE clause in an ESQL CREATE statement Ensure that the libraries that provide the message model are deployed correctly.

File node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' could not delete file ''{2}'' because another thread is using it. \n\nThe flow is unable to continue processing because the file is in use. The node waited for 1 second for the file to become free, but the file remained in use. The file node needed to delete the file, but another thread in the integration server containing the flow is using the file. This other thread could be an additional instance of the flow, or a different flow that uses the same file. \n\nIf no other flows in the same integration server are accessing the file, reducing or eliminating additional instances for this flow may prevent file contention, at the cost of reduced throughput.  \nIf other flows or instances are likely to contend for access to the file, it may help to set the Retry options on the flow''s input node to allow multiple attempts. 

2210: BIP2210E: \
Invalid configuration message: attribute name ''{0}'' not valid for target object ''{1}''. \n\nThe integration node received a configuration message containing the attribute name ''{0}'' which is not valid for the target object ''{1}''.  This can be caused by a mismatch in levels between the Integration Toolkit and the integration node, or as a result of a user or third party written user-defined node where the implementation library installed at the integration node does not match the node definition held at the Integration Toolkit. \n\nEnsure that the levels of code installed at the Integration Toolkit and integration node are consistent.

4323: BIP4323E: \
The DecisionService node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' could not locate the ruleset ''{4}'' that is defined by the decision service ''{6}''. \n\nThe DecisionService node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' (application ''{2}'', library ''{3}'') is configured to use the integration node decision service repository. The ruleset ''{4}'' with namespace ''{5}'' cannot be located in the integration node decision service repository. \n\nIf the ruleset is deployed to a remote decision service repository, select the option "Use DecisionServiceRepository configurable service". You must configure the default DecisionServiceRepository configurable service with the path of an ra.xml file that defines the repository connection. If you are using a decision service deployed to the integration server, do not select the option "Use DecisionServiceRepository configurable service". Check that the decision service ''{6}'' is deployed to the integration server. 

5903: BIP5903W: \
Invalid configuration message: type ''{0}'' invalid for parser factory ''{1}''. \n\nThe integration node received a configuration message containing an instruction to create a message format detail of type ''{0}'' but this is not a valid type for parser factory ''{1}''. \n\nNo user action required. 

4881: BIP4881E: \
CORBA node ''{0}'' in message flow ''{1}'' in integration server ''{2}'' cannot connect to the naming service located at ''{3}''. \n\nThe CORBA nodes need to communicate with a naming service to access object references. If the node cannot communicate with the naming service, the node cannot function. \n\nCheck that the Naming service property of the node is configured correctly. If the configuration is correct, check that the naming service is running and that a firewall is not preventing the integration node from communicating with the naming service. If the Naming service property refers to a configurable service, ensure that the configurable service exists and that the integration node has been restarted since the configurable service was created. To verify that the problem is resolved, restart the message flow. 

2191: BIP2191E: \
ActivityLog configurable service ''{0}'' is missing a mandatory property ''{1}''. \n\nThe ActivityLog configurable service definition ''{0}'' requires property ''{1}'' to be set.

3587: BIP3587E: \
No connections are available on Hostname ''{0}'', Port ''{1}''. \n\nNo connections are available for the specified port and hostname. This situation can occur because the maximum number of connections has been reached and they are all in use, or because the server is either unavailable or is failing to accept connections within the required time. \n\nEnsure that the server application is running and accepting connections, and that the maximum connections limit has not been reached. 

2212: BIP2212E: \
Invalid configuration message containing action ''{0}'' which is not valid for target object ''{1}''. \n\nThe integration node received a configuration message containing the action ''{0}'' which is not valid for the target object ''{1}''. This can be caused by a mismatch in levels between the Integration Toolkit and the integration node, or as a result of a user or third party written user-defined node where the implementation library installed at the integration node does not match the node definition held at the Integration Toolkit. \n\nEnsure that the levels of code installed at the Integration Toolkit and integration node are all consistent.  If they are, identify the supplier of the target object and report the problem to them.  If this is IBM, contact your IBM support center. 

4307: BIP4307E: \
The decision service ''{0}'' cannot be created because an exception occurred.  The exception is ''{1}''.

4697: BIP4697E: \
The JMSInput Node ''{0}'' could not process a non-transactional message. A backout destination has either not been defined or sending the message to the backout destination has failed. Since the message can not be rolled back the message has been discarded. \n\nNode ''{0}'' has been unable to process a transactional message. Either no backout destination has been defined, or an attempt to backout the message has failed. Since non-transactional messages can not be rolled back, the integration node has discarded this message. \n\nDefine a backout destination for this node. Examine previous messages and the message flow to determine why the message is can not be processed.  Correct this situation if possible. 

3592: BIP3592E: \
Attempted to read from a TCP/IP input stream (Hostname ''{0}'', Port ''{1}'', connectionId ''{2}''), which has already been closed by node ''{3}''. \n\nA TCP/IP node has attempted to read data from Hostname ''{0}'', Port ''{1}'' through a TCP/IP connection (ID ''{2}''). However, the input stream has previously been closed (by node ''{3}''). When a connection''s input stream has been closed, it cannot be used for reading data and it cannot be reopened. \n\nSee further messages to determine which node was trying to use this connection. It is likely that the "idLocation" property of the current node is set to a field in the incoming message that identifies a connection whose input stream has previously been closed. If it is not important which connection you use (and therefore you do not need to use this particular connection), change this property or remove the field from the message. As a result the node will find any connection whose input stream is not closed and that has data waiting to be read. Alternatively, if you do need to use this particular connection, reconfigure the first node to prevent it from closing the stream. 

2131: BIP2131E: \
A character codepage conversion error has occurred. \n\nAn internal software error has occurred in the integration node. \n\nShutdown and restart the integration node.

3908: BIP3908E: \
The field reference ''{0}'' could not be used to resolve the data location in the incoming message. \n\nAn attempt was made to use the specified field reference to resolve a data location in the incoming message. However the resulting data location failed to resolve to a location in the incoming message tree that contains data that can be processed by the node. \n\nReview the data location property on the node and make sure that it points to a valid location. 

4732: BIP4732E: \
Incorrect XPath expression ''{0}'' for the JMS property ''{1}'' in the JMSHeader node ''{2}'' in message flow ''{3}''. \n\nThe value returned by the XPath expression is not valid for property ''{1}''. \n\nCheck the value that is returned by the XPath expression, and correct the expression to return a value of 1 or 2. 

3578: BIP3578E: \
Invalid value for ''{0}'' configurable service ''{1}'' ExpireConnectionSec. Value: ''{2}''. \n\nThe ExpireConnectionSec property must be a valid integer greater than or equal to -1. A value of -1 signals that connections are never expired. No other negative value is supported. \n\nEnsure that the value is set to an integer greater than or equal to -1. 

3065: BIP3065E: \
Error message ''{0}'' from trace node ''{1}''. \n\nThe trace node ''{1}'' has output the specified error message. \n\nThis is an error message provided by the message flow designer.  The user response will be determined by the local environment.

5828: BIP5828E: \
The DFDL serializer could not locate a message model for the application ''{0}''. \n\nThe DFDL serializer is attempting to serialize a message tree, but a message model for the application ''{0}'' cannot be located. A message model for the application is built from all DFDL schemas in the application and its libraries when the application is deployed to the integration server. This situation can arise for one of the following reasons:  \n- No DFDL schemas exist in the application and its libraries.  \n- An error occurred during the preprocessing of the DFDL schemas in the application and its libraries. \n\nThe DFDL serializer is attempting to serialize a message tree using a message model for the application ''{0}''. This serialization is being attempted because the following properties are not set or are set to a blank, and the message flow is running inside an application.  \n- In the ''Message Model'' property of an input node, a Validate node, or any other node that offers this property.  \n- In an MQRFH2 header  \n- In the SET parameter of the PARSE clause in an ESQL CREATE statement Ensure that the application and its libraries that provide the message model are deployed correctly.

Attempted to write to a TCP/IP output stream (Hostname ''{0}'', Port ''{1}'', connectionId ''{2}'') which has already been closed by node ''{3}''. \n\nA TCP/IP node has attempted to send data to Hostname ''{0}'', Port ''{1}'', through a TCP/IP connection (ID ''{2}''). However, the output stream has previously been closed (by node ''{3}''). When a connection''s output stream has been closed, it cannot be used for sending data and it cannot be reopened. \n\nSee further messages to determine which node was trying to use this connection. It is likely that the "idLocation" property of the current node is set to a field in the incoming message that identifies a connection whose output stream was previously closed. If it is not important which connection you use (and therefore you do not need to use this particular connection), change this property or remove the field from the message. As a result the node will find any connection whose output stream is not closed. Alternatively, if you do need to use this particular connection, reconfigure the first node to prevent it from closing the stream. 

5730: BIP5730E: \

This Java class was packaged inside the JAR file ''{5}'' and deployed within a BAR file to the integration server, and is not valid for use with the global cache. \n\nJava classes packaged inside a JAR file and deployed within a BAR file to the integration server are not valid for use with the global cache. These Java classes are not visible to the internal global cache components. \n\nTo use this Java class with the global cache, remove the Java class from the deployed JAR file. Package the Java class in a separate JAR file and make the JAR file available to the integration server by copying it into the shared-classes directory. Ensure that the integration server is restarted after these changes have been made. 

3977: BIP3977E: \
A database insert operation was attempted without any specified column values. The datasource name is ''{0}'' and table name is ''{1}''. \n\nThe mapping node attempted to insert a row to a database table without any specified column values. This could be caused by the database policy settings on each of the mapped inputs excluding all of the values. \n\nInspect the diagnostic information, and check the user trace for further information. 

3860: BIP3860E: \
The SalesforceRequest node received data that was not in JSON format while it was performing the ''{0}'' operation. \n\nA JSON message was expected as input to the SalesforceRequest node. The message body contained data that was not in JSON format, so the SalesforceRequest node was unable to perform the ''{0}'' operation. \n\nCheck that a JSON message body is passed to the SalesforceRequest node.

The line number and column number that are quoted in the message give the position where the parser discovered the problem. However, the actual error might be earlier in the message.  \nOther possible causes are:  \n1. A character that is not supported by XML occurs in the instance message data.  \n     XML supports only a subset of control characters; therefore, ensure that no unsupported characters, such as X''00'', appear in the document.  \n2. The Coded Character Set ID that is defined in the message header does not reflect the contents of the instance message.  \n     If the XML document has an XML prologue, the WebSphere MQ CodedCharSetId should be consistent with the XML Encoding field.  \n3. A reserved XML character appears in the instance message data.  \n     Characters that might be recognized as XML markup - for example, < and & - should be replaced with the corresponding XML entities - &lt; and &amp;.

5027: BIP5027E: \
Validation is enabled but a message model for the integration server cannot be located. \n\nThe XMLNSC parser is attempting to validate an XML message or a message tree, but a message model for the integration server cannot be located. A message model for the integration server is built from all XML schemas in any libraries deployed to the integration server. This situation can arise for one of the following reasons:  \n- No XML schemas exist in any libraries that are deployed to the integration server.  \n- An error occurred during the preprocessing of the XML schemas in the libraries. \n\nThe XMLNSC parser is attempting to validate an XML message or a message tree against a message model for the integration server. This validation is being attempted because the following properties are not set or are set to blank, and the message flow is running outside an application.  \n- In the ''Message Model'' property of an input node, a Validate node, or any other node that offers this property.  \n- In an MQRFH2 header  \n- In the SET parameter of the PARSE clause in an ESQL CREATE statement Ensure that the libraries that provide the message model are deployed correctly. 

5021: BIP5021E: \

Element must have a namespace specified if there is a default namespace in scope. \n\nWhilst writing the XMLNS message, element {0} was found to be in scope of a default namespace, but this element does not have a namespace defined. \n\nThis error can occur if the NamespaceDecl correlation name has been used to create a default namespace for a parent element, and a child element has been created that does not have a namespace. If you have defined a default namespace in your output message tree, then all elements that are in scope of this default namespace must be defined to be in a namespace. Modify the output message tree so that element {0} is defined to be in a namespace. If element {0} belongs to the default namespace, then this element needs to be created in the default namespace. 

5013: BIP5013E: \
In the XMLNS domain XMLNS attributes must be specified in the ESQL using the NamespaceDecl correlation name. \n\nThe XMLNS attribute {0} was specified as an Attribute not as a NamespaceDecl element. \n\nModify the ESQL to specify the correlation name NamespaceDecl for the element.

Unable to open WebSphere MQ queue manager ''{2}'' for inquire: MQCC={0}; MQRC={1}. \n\nAn attempt to open the named connected WebSphere MQ queue manager ''{2}'' failed when inquiring about its object attributes. The WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes are as displayed. \n\nCheck the WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes in the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference manual to establish the cause of the error, and take the appropriate action. You might have to restart the integration node after you take this recovery action. 

6043: BIP6043E: \
Invalid folder size of ''{0}'' detected within a WebSphere MQ MQRFH2 header. \n\nThe folder size defined in an MQRFH2 header must be a multiple of four bytes, and must not be negative. The message being processed does not conform to this rule. \n\nCorrect the application or the compute expression that generated the message. 

2685: BIP2685E: \
The node of type ''{0}'' named ''{1}'' requires a queue manager to be specified on the integration node. \n\nThis node stores its state on the queue manager that is specified on the integration node, and cannot function without it. \n\nSpecify a queue manager for the integration node, and then deploy the component again. 

2652: BIP2652E: \
Message backed out to a queue; node ''{0}''. \n\nNode ''{0}'' has received a message which has previously been backed out one or more times because of a processing error in the main path of the message flow. \n\nExamine previous messages and the message flow to determine why the message is being backed out.  Correct this situation if possible.  Perform any local error recovery processing required. 

6046: BIP6046E: \
Mismatched start and end tags at offset ''{0}'': data just before the error is ''{1}''; data just after the error is ''{2}''. \n\nThe MQRFH2 parser encountered an end tag that did not match the currently open start tag in the name-value data area. The offset is from the beginning of the name-value length field which precedes the name-value data field that contains the error. \n\nCorrect the application or the compute expression that generated the message. 

2643: BIP2643W: \
Unable to commit a WebSphere MQ transaction; MQCMIT failed; queue manager={0}, MQCC={1}, MQRC={2}. \n\nThe integration node was unable to commit a WebSphere MQ unit of work because the MQCMIT function failed. The state of any messages processed within the unit of work may be unpredictable, depending on the reason for the WebSphere MQ error. \n\nCheck the WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes in the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference manual to establish the cause of the error, taking any appropriate action.  It may be necessary to restart the integration node after you have performed this recovery action. 

2634: BIP2634E: \
Exception condition detected: object label ''{0}''; input node ''{1}''. \n\nAn input node detected an error whilst processing a message. The message flow has been rolled back and, if the message was being processed in a unit of work, will remain on the input queue to be processed again. Following messages will indicate the cause of this exception which was generated in the STL container classes. \n\nCheck the error messages which follow to determine why the exception was generated, and take action as described by those messages. 

2660: BIP2660E: \
The message received at output node ''{4}'' is empty. State = ''{0}'' ''{1}'' ''{2}'' ''{3}'' \n\nThe IBM Integration Bus output node ''{4}'' received a message to write to a queue, but the message''s bit stream is too short to be a valid message.

6045: BIP6045E: \
Value at offset ''{0}'' must start with single or double quote: data just before error is ''{1}''; data just after error is ''{2}''. \n\nAttribute Values in the option buffer must start with a single or a double quote.  The value at the message offset indicated did not. \n\nCorrect the application (or compute expression) that generated the message. 

2655: BIP2655W: \
MQOptimizedFlow has detected a non-JMS input message \n\nAn MQOptimizedFlow can only process JMS MQ messages. All input messages must be JMS compliant. If a dead letter queue (DLQ) is defined, the message will be sent to the dead letter queue. If a DLQ is not defined the flow will block \n\nTo take advantage of this optimized pubsub node, use the JMS message model 

6101: BIP6101E: \
An error has occurred in the {0} parser when reading a message. \n\nThe parser has encountered an error whilst trying to read a part of the message or message header. \n\nCheck the application that generated the message to ensure that the message is well formed. If the problem persists, you should report it to the support organization responsible for the parser that detected the error. If this is an IBM supplied parser, you should contact your IBM support center. 

2647: BIP2647E: \
Error condition detected on input node: ''{0}''. \n\nInput node ''{0}'' received a message, but a warning was received from the MQGET operation. The failure terminal is not attached, so the integration node is putting the message directly to the requeue or dead letter backout queue associated with this node. \n\nExamine the other messages to determine why the message is not being received as expected. Correct this situation if possible.  Perform any local error recovery processing required. 

2675: BIP2675W: \
The queue manager is reporting the next message in our current message group is not available. \n\nQueue manager ''{0}'' returned a 2033 whilst reading queue ''{1}''. The message group identifier is ''{2}'' and the last sequence number processed was ''{3}''. This message group is incomplete. The MQInput nodes All Messages Available option was set to ''{4}''. \n\nIf the All Messages Available option was selected then all the messages must have been available for the message group to have started. Check to see if any messages have expired or if any other applications are retrieving messages off this queue. If the All Messages Available option was not selected then the message group could have started before all the messages were available. Check why all the group messages are not available on the input queue. 

6124: BIP6124E: \
Can not load MQ libraries from Installation Path (''{0}'') due to error (''{1}''). \n\nCan not load MQ libraries from Installation Path (''{0}'') due to error (''{1}''). \n\nEnsure that the MQ libraries install path points to a valid set of MQ libraries. 

2684: BIP2684E: \
A component was configured to use WebSphere MQ, but the required MQ libraries are not available. \n\nThe MQ libraries that are required for interaction with WebSphere MQ are not available. \n\nCheck that WebSphere MQ is installed, and that it is available in the environment that is running the integration node. 

6021: BIP6021E: \
The RFH option buffer length was ''{0}'', however no name/value data was present. \n\nThe buffer length was ''{0}'', however no name/value pairs were found in the option buffer. \n\nConsult the support team responsible for the application generating the RFH messages.

2682: BIP2682W: \
Unable to rollback a WebSphere MQ transaction due to a broken connection to the WebSphere MQ queue manager (''{0}''). MQRC={1}. \n\nAn attempt to rollback a WebSphere MQ unit of work using the MQBACK function has failed. The rollback failed because the connection to the queue manager is broken. WebSphere MQ will detect that the connection is broken and automatically rollback the unit of work at a later point in time. All other resources being backed out will continued to be backed out. \n\nEven though the MQBACK has failed due to a broken connection, the transaction will be backed out automatically by WebSphere MQ when it detects that the connection is broken. 

2666: BIP2666E: \
Unable to open queue ''{5}'' on WebSphere MQ queue manager ''{4}'': completion code {6}; reason code {2}. \n\nAn failure occurred when opening the indicated WebSphere MQ message queue. The error codes relate to the MQOPEN call. \n\nCheck the WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes in the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference manual to establish the cause of the error, and take the appropriate action. You might have to restart the integration node after you take this recovery action. If the failure to open occurred because the queue manager or queue did not exist, define these objects to WebSphere MQ.  If the failure occurred because incorrect object names were specified, correct the message flow configuration, and attempt to redeploy the integration node. 

2680: BIP2680E: \
Failed to setup a MQ control callback for component ''{0}'' to queue ''{1}'' on queue manager ''{2}'': MQCC={3}; MQRC={4}. \n\nComponents like MQInput nodes use the WebSphere MQ callback mechanism to receive messages from queues. A failure happened while trying to setup the WebSphere MQ control callback due to reason code {4}. The WebSphere MQ  function being called was MQCTL. \n\nCheck the WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes in the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference online help to determine the cause of the error, and take the appropriate action. If the error is MQ_ENVIRONMENT_ERROR (2012), then a likely cause is that the connected channel has the SHARECNV option set to 0. Ensure that this channel''s SHARECNV parameter is set to a value of 1 or greater. Ideally SHARECNV should be set to the default value of 10. 

2625: BIP2625E: \

Name ''{0}'' has no associated value. \n\nA name was found in the name/value option buffer with no associated value. \n\nCheck the application that generated the message. 

2645: BIP2645E: \
Exception condition detected on input node ''{0}''. \n\nNode ''{0}'' has received a message, but an exception was generated while initializing its internal representation. The failure terminal is not attached, so the integration node is putting the message directly to the requeue or dead letter backout queue that is associated with this node. \n\nIf ''complete'' or ''immediate'' message body validation for the MRM, DFDL, JSON or XMLNSC domain is being applied to messages that are received by this node, it''s possible that the format of the body of the received message is not valid. Examine further messages for confirmation of this, or to determine why the message is not being received as expected. Correct this situation if possible. Perform any local error recovery processing that is required. 

2683: BIP2683E: \
A component was configured to use the queue manager that is specified on the integration node, but no queue manager was found for the integration node. \n\nBy default, components in IBM Integration Bus use the queue manager that is specified on the integration node to connect to WebSphere MQ. No queue manager is specified on the integration node, so the component cannot resolve the connection to a queue manager. For MQInput, MQOutput, MQReply, and MQGet nodes, it is possible to specify a queue manager on the message flow node, but for Aggregation, Collector, Sequence, and Resequence nodes, the queue manager must be specified on the integration node. \n\nSpecify a queue manager on the integration node, or use a queue manager that is specified on a MQInput, MQOutput, MQReply, or MQGet node. 

6041: BIP6041E: \
Bitstream cannot be aligned to a four byte boundary in codepage ''{0}''. \n\nThe bitstream for this parser should be aligned on a four byte boundary.

2611: BIP2611E: \
Unable to open WebSphere MQ backout requeue queue: queue manager=''{0}''; queue=''{1}''; MQCC={2}; MQRC={3}; ''{4}''. \n\n''{4}'' was unable to open or get the backout requeue queue to backout a WebSphere MQ message, with the indicated WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes. The message might not be backed out as intended. \n\nIf there is a previous message, take the recovery actions that are described for that error. Otherwise check the WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes, and take the appropriate action. 

2648: BIP2648E: \
Message backed out to a queue; message flow node ''{0}''. \n\nMessage flow node ''{0}'' received a message which has previously been backed out one or more times because of a processing error in the main path of the message flow. The failure terminal is not attached, so the integration node is putting the message directly to the requeue or dead letter backout queue associated with this node. The MQMD ''backoutCount'' of the message now equals the ''backoutThreshold'' defined for the WebSphere MQ input queue. \n\nExamine previous messages and the component to determine why the message is being backed out.  Correct this situation if possible.  Perform any local error recovery processing required. 

6114: BIP6114E: \
The value of field name ''{0}'' must be an interval, its value was ''{1}''. \n\nThe type of this element must be an interval for this field. \n\nCheck the application (or compute expression) generating the message, and verify that the message agrees with any definition held in the message repository.

Invalid queue manager or queue name. State = ''{0}'' ''{1}'' ''{2}'' ''{3}'' \n\nThe queue manager or queue name cannot be converted to a form acceptable to the queue manager. This may be because it contains characters not available in the queue manager''s code page or because it is too long \n\nCheck the message flow to determine whether the message is being built correctly.  If not, correct the problem and redeploy the integration node. 

6122: BIP6122E: \
Parameter type of ''{0}'' for PCF headers is not handled by the PCF parser. \n\nThe parameter type specified is not valid when used in the command header. \n\nThe message flow processing the message must be modified to avoid referencing or setting the contents of the WebSphere MQ PCF header containing the unsupported parameter type. 

2686: BIP2686E: \
 ''{0}'' is configured to use a client connection to MQ but this is not supported on z/os. \n\nz/os does not support MQ client connections. \n\nChange ''{0}'' to use a server connection rather than a client connection. 

2668: BIP2668E: \
A single error occurred in output node ''{0}'' during destination list processing. \n\nOne error occurred while processing a destination list (i.e. whilst putting many messages). \n\nCheck the following messages for details of the errors and the preceding messages for details of the effect these have had on message processing.

2663: BIP2663E: \
Invalid reply to queue manager or queue name in ''{4}''. State = ''{0}'' ''{1}'' ''{2}'' ''{3}'' \n\nThe reply to queue manager or reply to queue name cannot be converted to a form acceptable to the queue manager. This might be because it contains characters not available in the queue manager''s code page, or because it is too long. \n\nCorrect the output node configuration, and redeploy the message flow. 

2673: BIP2673E: \
Unable to rollback a WebSphere MQ transaction; MQBACK failed; queue manager=''{0}'', MQCC={1}, MQRC={2}; message flow node. Use the WebSphere MQ return code and reason code returned to establish the cause of the error and take appropriate action. To protect the transaction this process will now terminate as the transaction state has become and may remain in doubt. \n\nAn attempt to rollback a WebSphere MQ unit of work using the MQBACK functions has failed.  The WebSphere MQ return code and reason code returned from MQBACK are displayed. \n\nCheck the WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes in the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference manual to establish the cause of the error, taking any appropriate action.  It may be necessary to restart the integration node after you have performed this recovery action. 

2601: BIP2601E: \
Unable to locate the WebSphere MQ manager class required by node ''{0}''. \n\nThe instance of the WebSphere MQ manager class could not be located when required by node ''{0}''.  The current message flow has been terminated.  This error is probably indicative of an internal software malfunction. \n\nIf this occurs frequently, restart the integration node.  If it continues to occur, contact your IBM support center. 

2693: BIP2693E: \
A message flow ''{0}'' that is using coordinated transactions cannot be deployed, because no queue manager is associated with the integration node. \n\nThe message flow ''{0}'' cannot deploy because it is configured to use coordinated transactions, which requires that a queue manager is associated with the integration node. This queue manager performs the role of transaction coordinator. You must associate a queue manager with the integration node for globally coordinated transactions. \n\nRun the mqsichangebroker command to specify a queue manager for the integration node. Alternatively, do not use coordinated transactions in this message flow. 

2638: BIP2638E: \
Failed to write a message to queue ''{1}'' on queue manager ''{0}''. The MQCC was ''{2}'' and the MQRC was ''{3}''. 

2602: BIP2602E: \
Unable to create thread context in message flow node ''{0}''. \n\nDuring the execution of a message flow in node ''{0}'', a new thread was created.  However, a context data area could not be created for this thread.  The current message flow is terminated. \n\nThis may be indicative of a shortage of virtual memory.  If other error messages seem to indicate this may be the reason, then consider reducing the memory requirements for the system, or increase the amount of physical and/or virtual memory available.  If lack of storage does not seem to be the reason, and this problem occurs continually contact your IBM support center. 

6108: BIP6108E: \
The value of field name ''{0}'' must be a byte string, its value was ''{1}''. \n\nThe type of element for this field must be a byte string. \n\nCheck the application (or compute expression) generating the message, and verify that the message agrees with any definition held in the message repository. 

6111: BIP6111E: \
The value of field name ''{0}'' must be a time stamp, its value was ''{1}''. \n\nThe type of element for this field must be a time stamp. \n\nCheck the application (or compute expression) generating the message, and verify that the message agrees with any definition held in the message repository. 

2626: BIP2626E: \
Unable to open queue. Queue manager name ''{0}'' is too long; message flow node ''{1}''. \n\nThe message flow node ''{1}'' failed to open a WebSphere MQ queue, because the specified queue manager name ''{0}'' was longer than the maximum size allowed by WebSphere MQ. \n\nCorrect the message flow configuration and redeploy the integration node. 

2650: BIP2650E: \
Message backed out to a queue; node ''{0}''. \n\nNode ''{0}'' has received a message which has previously been backed out one or more times because of a processing error in the main path of the message flow. The failure terminal is attached, but previous attempts to successfully process the message down this terminal have also failed. The MQMD ''''backoutCount'''' of the message now equals twice the ''''backoutThreshold'''' defined for the WebSphere MQ input queue. Having now reached the ''''attempt limit'''' for both these paths in the flow, the integration node is now putting the message to the requeue or dead letter backout queue associated with this node. \n\nExamine previous messages and the message flow to determine why the message is being backed out.  Also, examine previous messages to determine why the error is not being successfully processed when routed down the failure terminal. Correct these situations if possible. Perform any local error recovery processing required. 

2614: BIP2614E: \
Unable to commit a WebSphere MQ transaction to backout; MQCMIT failed; queueName=''{0}'', MQCC={1}, MQRC={2}. \n\nA WebSphere MQ unit of work, where the message needed to be backed out, was not committed, because the MQCMIT function failed. The state of the message flow and any messages processed within the unit of work can be unpredictable, depending on the reason for the WebSphere MQ error. \n\nCheck the WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes in the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference manual to establish the cause of the error, and take any appropriate action. You might have to restart the integration node after you take this recovery action. 

2630: BIP2630E: \
No backout queue or DLQ defined for a message to be backed out; received from queue ''{0}'' \n\nA message was received from queue ''{0}'', but a backout was forced due to the detection of an internal failure condition associated with it. The integration node has now attempted to propagate the message to the ''backoutRequeueQueueName'' or the dead letter queue, but neither of these queues exist. The message is no longer processed by the message flow and continues to be backed out periodically.  This situation can cause other messages to build up on the input queue until this message is removed or successfully processed. \n\nExamine previous messages and the message flow to determine why the message is being backed out. Defining either the ''backoutRequeueQueue'' or the dead letter queue will cause the message to be propagated to one of those queues. 

6118: BIP6118E: \
The remaining bitstream is too small to contain the indicated structure. \n\nThe bitstream, as presented to the ''{1}'' parser, is too small to contain the ''{0}'' structure.  The length of this structure as given in the structure header is ''{2}''.  The message appears to have been truncated. \n\nCheck with the support group responsible for the parser in question. 

6047: BIP6047E: \
Syntax error in attribute specification at offset ''{0}'': data just before the error is ''{1}''; data just after the error is ''{2}''. \n\nThe MQRFH2 parser expected an ''='' following the attribute name at the offset indicated. \n\nCorrect the application or the compute expression that generated the message. 

2631: BIP2631I: \
Backed out message being propagated to failure terminal; message flow node ''{0}''. \n\nMessage flow node ''{0}'' received a message which has previously been backed out because of a processing error in the message flow. The MQMD ''backoutCount'' of the message exceeds (or equals) the ''backoutThreshold'' defined for the WebSphere MQ input queue.  The integration node is propagating the message to the failure terminal of the node. \n\nExamine the other messages and the message flow to determine why the message is being backed out. Correct this situation if possible. Perform any local error recovery processing required. 

2636: BIP2636E: \
Warning when receiving a message: MQGET returned MQCC={0}, MQRC={1}; message flow node ''{2}''. \n\nThe message flow node ''{2}'' received a message from a queue, but a warning was generated. The return and reason code from the MQGET operation are as displayed.  The message will be propagated to the failure terminal of the node. \n\nCheck the WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes in the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference manual to establish the cause of the error, taking any appropriate action. It may be necessary to restart the integration node after you have performed this recovery action. 

2613: BIP2613E: \
Unable to backout a message; MQPUT to queue ''{0}'' failed: MQCC={1}; MQRC={2}. \n\nThe message was unable to be backed out, because it failed to put the message to either the backout requeue queue or the WebSphere MQ dead letter queue, which is defined as queue ''{0}''. \n\nCheck the WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes in the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference manual to establish the cause of the error, and take the appropriate action. You might have to restart the integration node after you take this recovery action. 

6116: BIP6116E: \
Integration node internal program error. \n\nAn attempt was made to parse a message but no parse buffer was supplied. This is an internal error in the parser. \n\nContact your IBM support center. 

6105: BIP6105E: \
The remaining bitstream is too small to contain an ''{0}'' structure. \n\nThe bitstream, as presented to the ''{1}'' parser, is too small to contain a structure of type ''{0}''.  The message appears to have been truncated. \n\nCheck with the support group responsible for the parser in question. 

2635: BIP2635E: \
Exception during destination list processing; output node ''{0}''. \n\nWhile processing a destination list in the output node ''{0}'' an error (or errors) occurred. \n\nCheck the preceding error messages to determine what effect this error causes, taking any action as described by those messages. 

2615: BIP2615I: \
The WebSphere MQ component ''{0}'' has backed out the message to the backout requeue or the dead letter queue. \n\nMessage backout processing was invoked, and the message was backed out by being written to the backout requeue or dead letter queue, as determined by the WebSphere MQ queue manager and queue configuration. \n\nNo user action required. 

2624: BIP2624E: \
Unable to connect to queue manager ''{0}'': MQCC={1}; MQRC={2}; message flow node ''{3}''. \n\nThe message flow node ''{3}'' failed to connect to the WebSphere MQ queue manager ''{0}''.  The return and reason codes returned by the MQCONN are as displayed. \n\nCheck the WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes in the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference online help to establish the cause of the error, and take the appropriate action. You might have to restart the integration node after you take this recovery action. If the failure to open occurred because the queue manager did not exist, define this object to WebSphere MQ.  If the failure occurred because an incorrect queue manager name was specified, correct the message flow configuration, and attempt to redeploy the integration node. 

2617: BIP2617E: \
Output message is empty; output node ''{0}''. \n\nThe IBM Integration Bus message flow node ''{0}'' received a message to write to an IBM output queue, but the message appears to be empty.  This error can be generated when 1) there is no MQMD and no message content in the output bitstream (there is no data), or 2) there is no MQMD and the size of the message content is less than the size of the MQMD (it appears that there is no content).  This situation can occur when an output message is built incorrectly by using the Compute node. \n\nCheck the message flow to determine whether the message is being built correctly. If the message is not built correctly, correct the problem, and redeploy the integration node. 

6112: BIP6112E: \
The value of field name ''{0}'' must be a time, its value was ''{1}''. \n\nThe type of element for this field must be a time. \n\nCheck the application (or compute expression) generating the message, and verify that the message agrees with any definition held in the message repository. 

2690: BIP2690E: \
Failed to make a CCDT connection to queue manager ''{0}'': MQCC={1}; MQRC={2}. \n\nFailed to connect to the WebSphere MQ queue manager ''{0}''.  The return and reason codes returned by the MQCONN are as displayed. A reason code MQRC=2058 indicates that the CCDT file cannot be located, that the queue manager name is not defined in the CCDT file, or that there is a WebSphere MQ connection error. The connection parameters are MQCHLLIB=''{3}'' and MQCHLTAB=''{4}''. \n\nCheck the WebSphere MQ completion and reason codes in the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference online help to determine the cause of the error, and take the appropriate action. Ensure that the CCDT file location is set in the integration node property ''mqCCDT'', and that the integration node is restarted after setting this property.

5331: BIP5331E: \
A message dictionary error has occurred. An invalid tag name ''{3}'' was found for dictionary ''{2}'' in function ''{1}''. \n\nStandard dictionary error: Function ''{1}'' did not find the tag, alias, or type ''{3}'' in the dictionary ''{2}''. Tags must not be zero length, and tags, types, and aliases must not exceed 255 characters in length. This might be an internal error, or might indicate a problem with the dictionary. \n\nVerify that items such as message type (possibly embedded in the message itself) do not exceed 255 characters. Examine other tags that might exceed this value and reduce to the required length. Review further error messages for an indication of what caused the errors. Redeploy the message dictionary. 

5398: BIP5398E: \
Resource Manager: An invalid DateTime format or value was specified in message set ''{2}''. \n\nA request to register the runtime dictionary resource for message set ''{2}'' has been received by the integration node. However, this message set contains an invalid DateTime format or specifies a DateTime which is not valid for the given format. Therefore, the request has been rejected. \n\nThe integration node has received a deployment request containing an invalid DateTime format, an invalid value, or both, for the message set ''{2}''.  \nEnsure that all DateTime formats are specified correctly in this message set and that all DateTime values are valid for their associated format string.  \nAfter doing this, retry the deployment operation. 

5322: BIP5322E: \
Dictionary Info Error. \n\nUnable to set the Dictionary Info object in the setDictionaryInfo() call. \n\nReview further error messages for an indication to the cause of the errors.

5637: BIP5637E: \
TDS Worker: The tree contains an illegal choice element within type ''{0}''. \n\nThe TDS worker cannot handle open-defining or self-defining elements within some separation types. This error indicates that such an element has been located within a choice of such a type. The TDS worker is therefore unable to continue writing the message. \n\nConfirm that the choice resolution is correctly indicating a pre-defined element. 

5437: BIP5437E: \
The group indicator was missing in the bit stream.  Type or group: {0}  Group indicator expected: {1}  At offset: {2} \n\nThe MRM TDS parser could not parse the data in the bit stream for complex type or group ''{0}''. A group indicator ''{1}'' was not present in the bit stream at offset ''{2}''. \n\nThe message model definition does not match the bit stream.  \nCheck that your model definition is correct and if so, update your bit stream data accordingly.  \nCollect debug-level user trace for more information on how the model is being matched. 

5130: BIP5130E: \
Parser error retrieving dictionary handle: current message set id ''{0}''; current message id ''{1}''. \n\nError retrieving dictionary handle from message handle.  Current message set id  = {0}, current message id = {1}. \n\nCheck that you have deployed and are using the appropriate dictionary for the message being processed and resubmit the message. 

5667: BIP5667E: \
The value that is specified for the boundary parameter is not valid at or near {0}. \n\nA valid boundary parameter is required in the Content-Type header for multipart MIME. \n\nCheck that the Content-Type value is correct and that the boundary value does not include trailing white space. For information about MIME Content-Type and boundary, refer to the information center.

5394: BIP5394E: \
Resource Manager: A duplicate message set alias was specified on message set ''{2}''. \n\nA message set deployment request for message set ''{2}'' has been received by the integration node. However, the integration node already has a message set registered with the same ''Message Set Alias'' but a different ''Identifier''. This would result in an ambiguous resource being registered and thus the request has been rejected. \n\nThe integration node was requested to register a runtime message set resource (dictionary) using an ambiguous ''Message Set Alias''. The most likely reason for this error is that there is already a message set deployed with this ''Message Set Alias'' (but a different identifier). You should either remove the existing message set deployment or modify the ''Message Set Alias'' of the message set currently being deployed. 

5666: BIP5666W: \
The following encoding value will be interpreted as 0 by the MIME parser: {0}. \n\nThe encoding value supplied is invalid. \n\nCheck that the encoding value was set correctly. If the value appears to be valid please contact your IBM support center.

An element does not meet the minOccurs constraint.  element: {0}  instances: {1}  minOccurs: {2}  parent: {3}  parent index: {4} \n\nElement ''{0}'' has ''{1}'' instances in the logical tree, but has been defined with a minOccurs constraint of ''{2}'' within its parent type/element ''{3}'' of index ''{4}''. \n\nTrace the message tree, and compare it to the message definition used for validation.  \nAlter the message set, decreasing the minOccurs constraint or setting a default value for this element, then redeploy to the integration node.  \nAlternatively increase the number of instances of the element in the message itself. 

5371: BIP5371E: \
There was a message validation error. Element or attribute ''{0}'' failed to validate. The path to the element is ''{1}''. The element is defined as a child of a complex type or group that has a content validation setting of ''Closed'' and composition ''{2}''. \n\nPossible causes could be:  \n1. The child has not been defined as a member of its parent complex type or group.  \n2. The child has been created out of order in the logical tree, for the ordered compositions (''Ordered Set'' or ''Sequence'').  \n3. The child is a duplicate, which is not allowed for a composition of ''Ordered Set'' or ''Unordered Set''. \n\nAs appropriate:  \nModify the message set and redeploy it to the integration node.  \nModify the message flow and redeploy it to the integration node.  \nModify the input message and resubmit it to the integration node. 

5430: BIP5430E: \
No tag length while extracting Fixed Length Tag in TDS message. \n\nThe TDS message definition does not provide a required Tag Length property for an element, either at project level or at complex type/group level. \n\nMake sure that in the TDS message definition, all required Tag Length properties are set. 

5471: BIP5471E: \

Numeric value ''{0}'' can only be in exponential notation if the format is ''Exponential Notation''. \n\nUnder strict numeric checking, a numeric value cannot be in exponential notation unless the format is specified as ''Exponential Notation''. \n\nConsider using a different numeric precision. 

5446: BIP5446E: \
The data length associated with element ''{0}'' was invalid.  Length ''{1}'' calculated from offset ''{2}'' is invalid. \n\nThe MRM TDS parser could not extract data from the bit stream for element ''{0}'', because an invalid length (''{1}'') was calculated at offset (''{2}'').  \nDuring the parsing of a complex type or group with Data Element Separation of ''Tagged Encoded Length'', this error occurred because the value resulting from the data length in the bit stream, combined with the value of the ''Extra Chars In Encoded Length'' property, resulted in a negative number.  \nDuring the parsing of a complex type or group with Data Element Separation of ''Fixed Length'', this error occurred because the value of the element referenced by the ''Length Value Of'' is a negative number. \n\nCheck the value parsed for previous elements in the bit stream, as an error in their length might have resulted in the misinterpretation of the input message bit stream, resulting in the wrong value being used as a length value.

If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

5283: BIP5283E: \
Invalid repeating field within complex element ''{0}''. \n\nA repeating element was detected within a complex element, {0}. The repeating element was either not defined as repeating or was incorrectly encoded in the physical message. For example there may be another element between the instances of the repeating elements. \n\nCheck that you have packaged the message correctly and set the correct message properties then resubmit the message. 

5629: BIP5629S: \
There has been an attempt to write a value that is not allowed for the Boolean Logical Type:  Current element: {0}  Data value     : {1} \n\nIf the element in the message tree has a logical type of integer its value must either equal 1 for true or 0 for false. If the element in the tree has a logical type of binary the value must equal one of the TDS Message Set properties Binary boolean true value, Binary boolean false value, or Binary boolean null value. See following messages for details of the message set and physical format. \n\nCheck that the value in the message tree is allowed for a Boolean logical data type.  \nCheck the MRM definition of the element.  \nSee following messages for more details. 

5188: BIP5188E: \
Custom Wire Format. Error reading date and time: message set ''{2}''; message ''{3}''; parent element ''{4}''; current element ''{5}''; function name ''{1}''; error code ''{0}''. \n\nAn error has occurred while reading a logical datetime from a Custom Wire Format file. \n\nRecord the full details provided with this message and contact your IBM support center. 

5343: BIP5343E: \
No physical format descriptor was found when a message in message set ''{0}'' was being processed. \n\nThe physical format name determines the parser or writer that is used to process a message. The message properties do not specify a physical format, and the message set (''{0}'') does not provide a default format. Therefore, the message cannot be parsed or written. \n\nEnsure that a physical format is supplied. You can specify the physical format name in the ''format'' field of the MQRFH2 header, in the input node properties, or in the ''Default Wire Format'' property of the message set.  \nSpecify the format by setting one of these properties, and redeploy. Check that the message set was deployed successfully. 

5558: BIP5558E: \
Numeric value ''{0}'' has VDP set, but contains a decimal point. \n\nUnder strict numeric checking, a numeric value with VDP set must not contain a decimal point.  \nConsider using a different numeric precision. 

5321: BIP5321E: \
Resource Manager: Configuration store error. \n\nThe integration node could not locate information in its configuration store. \n\nCheck for previous errors in the system event log, which might describe the cause of failure. Redeploying the complete integration node configuration by using the Integration Toolkit, the mqsideploy command, or the IBM Integration API, might solve the problem. If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

5462: BIP5462E: \
An MRM Custom Wire Format physical format parsing error has occurred.  The error occurred during the parsing of an element or group that repeats to the end of the bit stream.  Current message: {1}  Current element or group: {2}  Path from message root: {3}  Element or group occurrence: {4} \n\nInstances of the final element or group in a CWF message will be parsed until the end of the bit stream when the maxOccurs of the final element or group is ''-1''.  \nCheck that the message model is correct. Also examine the instance message being processed, to make sure it conforms to the model.  \nSee following errors for more details. 

5557: BIP5557E: \
Numeric value ''{0}'' does not contain ''{1}'' decimal places, as specified. \n\nUnder strict numeric checking, a numeric value must have the precision specified.  \nConsider using a different numeric precision.

Unable to set the datetime pattern to {1}. Error code: {0}. \n\nCheck and possibly correct the datetime pattern specified for the project. 

5451: BIP5451E: \
An error has occurred at offset ''{3}'' while the bit stream was being parsed. Data for element ''{0}'' of logical type ''{1}'' is longer than expected. \n\nThe MRM TDS parser could not complete parsing because the bit stream contains more data than expected for element ''{0}''.  \nThe data length for element ''{0}'' is defined in the model as ''{2}''. The number of data bytes extracted from the bit stream for element ''{0}'' is ''{4}''. This could be caused by either an incorrect message definition or by an incorrect message. \n\nCheck that your model definition is correct, and if so make sure that the incoming message is correct with respect to the message definition. 

5284: BIP5284E: \
Message Translation Interface error. Invalid element handle: message set ''{2}''; message ''{3}''; parent element ''{4}''; current element ''{5}''; function name ''{1}''; error code ''{0}''. \n\nThis error code is returned if the value in an element handle parameter passed into one of the Message Translation Interface functions is not a known handle or does not refer to a message element. \n\nCheck that you have a valid integration node installation.  If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

5228: BIP5228E: \

Message validation error. The value ''{1}'' for element ''{0}'' in the message is not valid.  The value is less than the minimum inclusive value ''{2}''. \n\nThe value for the element in the message is less than the minimum inclusive value specified for the element. \n\nModify the message set or message flow and redeploy to the integration node, or modify the input message and resubmit to the integration node.  \nSee the following messages for more details. 

5407: BIP5407E: \
XML parsing error: Element ''{0}'', with a namespace ''{1}'', was found when namespaces are not enabled for the message set. \n\nThe element with XML name ''{0}'' is in namespace ''{1}''. However namespaces have not been enabled for the message set. \n\nIf you intend to use namespaces ensure that namespaces have been enabled for the message set.  \nIf you do not intend to use namespaces ensure that no element or attribute is in a namespace. 

5381: BIP5381E: \
Resource Manager: An ambiguous dictionary was specified for message set ''{2}'', in function ''{1}''. \n\nThe runtime dictionary resource for message set ''{2}'' has been requested by the integration node in the function ''{1}'', however the resource cannot be obtained as the message set name is ambiguous. This means that multiple resources with this message set name have been deployed and thus the message set name specification cannot be reliably resolved. \n\nThe integration node was requested to load a dictionary using an ambiguous message set name. The most likely reason for this error is that there are multiple levels of a message set deployed with the same message set name. In this situation, the message set must be identified using the message set identifier (rather than the name). Alternatively, ensure that there are not multiple levels of the message set deployed to the integration node. 

5395: BIP5395E: \
An xsi:type attribute value on element ''{2}'' is invalid.  ''{0}'' is not a valid MemberType of union type ''{1}''. \n\nElement ''{2}'' is based on a union type ''{1}'' and has an xsi:type attribute with value ''{0}''. This should explicitly resolve the union ''{1}'' to one of its modeled memberTypes. The xsi:type attribute value ''{0}'' does not correspond to a valid memberType of union ''{1}''. \n\nModify the message so that the xsi:type attribute identifies a valid memberType of union ''{1}'', or check the message model, ensuring that union type {1} contains the correct list of simple types. 

5261: BIP5261E: \
Message Translation Interface error. Element not found: message set ''{2}''; message ''{3}''; parent element ''{4}''; current element ''{5}''; function name ''{1}''; error code ''{0}''. \n\nA search for a message element did not find the element. \n\nCheck that you have a valid integration node installation.  If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

5627: BIP5627E: \
The quote character ({0}) at byte offset ''{1}'' is invalid. \n\nA quote character is not allowed at this position in the message.  \nIf quoting is to be used, a quote character must occur at the start and end of a variable length field. \n\nEnsure the message being processed conforms to the message definition.  \nCheck the TDS physical format property ''quote character'' is specified correctly.  \nIf you want to include a quote character within a quoted field, include it twice, consecutively, in the bit stream. 

5481: BIP5481E: \

Data length error:  Element name: {0}  Element type: {1}  Expected data length: {2} {3}  Actual data length: {4} {5}  Data: {6} \n\nWhile a TDS message was being written, it was found that the data length was inconsistent with the element definition. \n\nIf the element is of binary data type, make sure that the length is the same as the expected length, as defined in the message definition.  \nIf the element is of string data type, make sure the length is not greater than the expected length. 

5569: BIP5569E: \
CWF Worker: The tree does not resolve a structure or group with type composition of Message.  Message name: ''{0}''  Element name: ''{1}'' \n\nThe CWF worker has encountered a structure or group with a type composition of Message and there no corresponding embedded message in the message tree. The type composition of ''Message'' provides a choice of messages to be resolved and so there must be at least one embedded message in the message tree. \n\nIf the tree does not contain the required embedded message then one needs to be created to resolve the type composition of message. If the tree does contain the required embedded message then ensure that this has been created at the correct location to match the messsage model. If the structure or group is repeating or contained within a repeating parent then ensure that all occurrences have been created up to the maxOccurs value.

5624: BIP5624E: \
The regular expression parser that is used by the integration node has encountered a problem.  Byte offset: {0}  Message name: {1}  Data Pattern: {2} \n\nThe problem is probably due to a pattern that the parser does not recognize or know how to parse. \n\nCheck the data pattern that you have specified for the element in the message model and ensure that the data pattern is a valid regular expression. 

5199: BIP5199E: \
Data overflow or underflow in field ''{0}'' of message ''{1}''. The message has a maximum or minimum length of {2} in the dictionary. The actual length is {3}. \n\nThe field {0} in message {1} has a maximum or minimum length defined in the dictionary of {2}. The actual value of the field has a length of {3}. \n\nModify the message set or message flow and redeploy to the integration node or modify the input message and resubmit to the integration node. 

5632: BIP5632S: \
The data length of element ''{0}'' does not equal the length matched by the data pattern.  Physical type: {1}  Data pattern length: {2} bytes  Data length: {3} Bytes \n\nThe data element separation of the parent is ''Use Data Pattern''. The physical type of the element is either ''Null Terminated String'', ''Length Encoded String 1'' or ''Length Encoded String 2''. The length specified by the physical type does not equal the length matched by the data pattern for the element in the message model.  \nSee following messages for details of the message set and physical format. \n\nOne of the following actions may resolve the problem:  \n1. Check that the correct data pattern has been specified for the element in the message model.  \n2. Check that the data for the element in the input message is correct. 

5465: BIP5465E: \
An MRM Custom Wire Format physical format field reference error has occurred.  The error occurred during the parsing or output of an element or attribute (field). This field has either a length reference or repeat reference defined. However, the value of the target of this field reference is invalid. The value of the target of the field reference must be a non-negative number.  Current message: {1}  Current field: {2}  Target of field Reference: {3}  Value of target of field reference: {4} \n\nOne of the following actions may resolve the problem:  \n Check that the length reference or repeat reference information has been correctly defined in the message model.  \n On parsing, ensure that the target of the field reference has been correctly parsed and that its value is not negative.  \n On output, ensure that the target of the field reference is present in the message tree and that its value is not negative.

5628: BIP5628I: \
When output, the value of the element or attribute ''{0}'' was truncated, based on a justification of ''{3}''. The element or attribute, of logical type STRING, is {1} characters long. This is longer than the defined length of {2} characters. \n\n The element or attribute is longer than the length set in the model or in the length reference. The message set level ''Truncate on output'' property of the TDS physical format is set to true. Therefore the element or attribute was truncated when it was output. \n\nNo action is required. 

5304: BIP5304E: \
A runtime dictionary resource for message set ''{2}'' cannot be found.  The list of known message sets is: {3} \n\nA runtime dictionary resource for a message set was requested by the integration node, but the resource could not be found as it is not registered to this integration server. This means that the message set was not  deployed, or was not deployed properly, to the integration server. \n\nCheck that the dictionary identifier (e.g. DLPLT0807A001) or dictionary name (shown in the Integration Toolkit for the message set) is the same as that specified in the message instance or input node of the message flow. Verify that the correct message set is associated with the integration server, and redeploy. 

5553: BIP5553E: \

The data has been discarded, and the message will be written without it. \n\nConfirm that the element matches that in the model, and that it is correctly described in the flow.  \nCollect debug-level user trace for more information on how the model is being matched. 

5290: BIP5290E: \
Invalid value for physical data type in Custom Wire Format: message set ''{2}''; message ''{3}''; parent element ''{4}''; current element ''{5}''; function name ''{1}''; error code ''{0}''. \n\nExamined the physical type of an element.  The value of the field to be written out is negative and the physical datatype for the output is unsigned. \n\nCheck that you have a valid physical type associated with this field in the Custom Wire Format characteristics or that the logic of the message flow is correct. 

5360: BIP5360E: \
The writing of NULL binary data is not supported in the Custom Wire Format physical format.  Message set: {0}  Message type: {1}  Element ID: {2} \n\nWhen message ''{1}'' was being written, binary element ''{2}'' had a NULL value. The CWF physical format does not support special representation of NULL values for binary items. \n\nUpdate the message flow to ensure that element ''{2}'' does not have a NULL value, or alter the message definition. 

5338: BIP5338E: \
A Dictionary Iterator Error has occurred during writing. \n\nDI Handler Error: Unable to spawn a new MtiImbDictionaryIterator object. This can occur if no Dictionary was specified or if there was insufficient memory to allocate a new Dictionary iterator object. \n\nExamine memory usage on the system and free up the required resources if necessary. Examine the message flow, if the input node does not require/specify a dictionary and it is not contained in the message instance (e.g. self defining XML) but the output format requires member ids e.g. CWF. Change the message flow, or specify the Dictionary in the instance if this is the case. Review further error messages for an indication to the cause of the errors. 

5406: BIP5406E: \
XML parsing error: Unexpected data was found before the start of the message content.  Unexpected data: {0}  Root tag name: {1} \n\nEnsure that the incoming message does not contain data between the root tag name (''{1}'') and the message tag. 

5506: BIP5506E: \
Data conversion failed: input data out of bounds.  Type of data being read : ''{0}''  Target data type        : ''{1}''  Data                    : ''{2}'' \n\nA data conversion during reading or writing of a message failed because the input data was out of bounds for the output data type.  \nCheck that the message model is correct. Review previous messages for details of the message set and message type.  \nCheck that the processed message is of the expected format and type. 

5377: BIP5377E: \
Message validation error. An unresolved choice within parent ''{0}'' could not be resolved using defaults. \n\nA parent element, ''{0}'', of composition ''Choice'' or ''Sequence'' that contains an embedded group of composition ''Choice'', could not be resolved. All resolutions of the choice were deemed to be mandatory. \n\nResolve the choice in the message flow. For example, refer to a specific member of the choice in a Compute node, a Java Compute node, or a Mapping node. 

5610: BIP5610I: \
''{0}'' has been matched as a repeating element delimiter for ''{1}'' at byte ''{2}''. 

5247: BIP5247E: \
An index error has occurred in the Message Translation Interface:  Message set: {2}  Message: {3}  Parent element: {4}  Current element: {5}  Function name: {1}  Error code: {0} \n\nAn internal error has occurred. This error is returned when a function that uses an index as a reference to an instance of an element or structure has been given an index value that is invalid. \n\nCheck that you have a valid integration node installation. If the problem persists contact your IBM support center. 

5532: BIP5532E: \
Unable to set calendar field. Field:{1}, value:{2}. Century window: {0}. \n\nCheck and possibly correct the datetime in the message. 

5567: BIP5567I: \
When output, the value of the element or attribute ''{0}'' was truncated, based on a justification of ''{4}''. The element or attribute, of logical type STRING, is {1} characters long. This is longer than the defined length of {2} (in length units of {3}). \n\n The element or attribute is longer than the length set in the model or in the length reference. The message set level ''Truncate fixed length strings'' property of the CWF physical format is set to true. Therefore the element or attribute was truncated when it was output. \n\nNo action is required. 

5478: BIP5478E: \
Message Translation Interface error. Null pointer: function name ''{1}''; error code ''{0}''. \n\nInternal Error.  An unexpected NULL pointer has been encountered within the PDF Worker. \n\nRecord the full details provided with this message and contact your IBM support center. 

5313: BIP5313E: \
Message format ''{3}'' is not defined for message set ''{2}''. \n\nThe integration node received a message for processing within the MRM domain.  \nHowever, the message cannot be processed because the message format specified in the physical format identifier ''{3}'' has not been defined for message set ''{2}''.  \nThe message format describes the physical representation of the message, and you can specify this format either in the properties on an input node, or dynamically within an MQRFH2 message header. \n\nIf the physical format identifier was intended to identify a message format, take one or more of the following actions:  \n1) Check that the message format has been specified correctly on the MQInput node, or within the MQRFH2 header.  \n2) Check that the correct message set has been specified on the MQInput node, or within the MQRFH2 header  \n3) Add the appropriate physical format information to your message set, and redeploy your message set.  \n4) Ensure that your message set has been correctly deployed.

5625: BIP5625E: \
A quote character ({0}) is missing. \n\nWhen parsing a field with an opening quote character, the end of the message was reached before finding the closing quote character.  \nThe problem might have occurred because you included a quote character within the field. \n\nEnsure the message being processed conforms to the message definition.  \nAs appropriate, add a closing quote character to the field being parsed, or remove the opening quote character.  \nIf you want to include a quote character within a quoted field, include it twice, consecutively, in the bit stream. 

5630: BIP5630S: \
It is not possible to output a null literal value for element ''{0}'' because the length of the data to be output cannot be calculated. \n\nThe element has a null value, the ''Nillable'' property is set to true, and ''Encoding Null'' property is set to ''NullLiteralFill''. However the length of the data to be output cannot be calculated. See following messages for details of the message set and physical format. \n\nCheck that the Physical Type is not set to ''Null Terminated'', ''Length Encoded String 1'' or ''Length Encoded String 2''.  \nIf the Fill value is a character, check that the length of the element is a whole number of characters. 

5186: BIP5186E: \
Custom Wire Format. Error reading date: message set ''{2}''; message ''{3}''; parent element ''{4}''; current element ''{5}''; function name ''{1}''; error code ''{0}''. \n\nAn error has occurred while reading a logical date from a Custom Wire Format file. \n\nRecord the full details provided with this message and contact your IBM support center.

If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

5358: BIP5358E: \
Multiple levels of unresolved embedded messages are not supported. \n\nThere is currently no support for embedded messages with unresolved identity embedded in another message with an unresolved identity. \n\nAn unresolved embedded message is a message that is contained in another message and whose identity is established by ESQL statements only. The current implementation supports only one level of unresolved embedded messages. 

5391: BIP5391E: \
An element of type xsd:list has been deemed complete with the number of ItemType instances greater than its maxLength constraint.  list element: {0}  length: {1}  maxLength: {2} \n\nElement ''{0}'' has ''{1}'' ItemType instances on the logical tree, but has been defined with a maxLength constraint of ''{2}''. \n\nAlter the message set, increasing the maxLength constraint and redeploy to the integration node, or decrease the number of ItemType instances in the message. 

5170: BIP5170E: \
A Custom Wire Format parsing error occurred. The value ''{3}'' of boolean element ''{2}'' in the bit stream did not match the logical definition. \n\nThe value in the bit stream (''{3}'') for element ''{2}'' did not match either the ''Boolean True'' or the ''Boolean False'' values defined in the message set. \n\nCheck that the ''Boolean True'' and ''Boolean False'' values on the CWF physical format properties of the message set are correct.  \nCheck that the message has been constructed correctly.  \nCheck that the message set and message type were correctly specified for the input message.  \nSee previous errors for further details. 

5527: BIP5527E: \
The epoch specified for a date-time element is invalid. Error code: {0}, epoch string: {1}. \n\nThe epoch is used with date-time when the date-time value has a physical type of seconds or milliseconds, and signifies the moment from which the seconds or milliseconds are counted. The epoch should be specified in the ''Format String'' field of the date-time properties CWF tab in the Integration Toolkit as a date-time string with the format ''yyyy-MM-dd''T''HH:mm ZZZ''. The default value for the epoch is ''1970-01-01T00:00 +00:00''. \n\nCheck the epoch value specified for the element. If the problem persists please record all the details provided with this error message and contact your IBM support center. 

5339: BIP5339E: \
There is a mismatch between the message tree and the logical definition. This occurred when element ''{2}'' in message set ''{1}'' was being written. \n\nWhile the message was being written, the message tree did not match the logical structure of the message. The problem was encountered while element ''{2}'' in message set ''{1}'' was being written. \n\nThis problem is usually caused by a badly-structured input message. It can also be caused by a badly-structured output message tree. Check that the structure of the input message matches the logical structure of the message definition. Check that elements defined as simple elements do not have child elements. If necessary, check that elements occur in the correct sequence, and with the correct number of repeats. If you have modified the message set or message type property in your message flow, check that these are correct. 

5603: BIP5603E: \
An error occurred while the TDS escape character was being specified. ''{0}'' is greater than one character in length. \n\nThe escape character specified, ''{0}'', is too long.

Invalid NLS string: message set ''{2}''; message ''{3}''; parent element ''{4}''; current element ''{5}''; function name ''{1}''; error code ''{0}''. \n\nThis error is returned when the Message Translation Interface encounters invalid data in an NLS string. \n\nCheck that you have a valid integration node installation.  If the problem persists contact, your IBM support center. 

5363: BIP5363E: \
Message Validation failure. Invalid value for element {0}.  The value {1} is shorter than the minimum length {2}. \n\nThe value for the element in the message is shorter than the minimum length specified for the element. \n\nModify the message set or messageflow and redeploy to the integration node or modify the input message and resubmit to the integration node.  \nSee following the messages for more details. 

5327: BIP5327E: \
A message dictionary error has occurred. A negative index was passed to function ''{1}'' for dictionary ''{2}''. \n\nStandard dictionary error: The function ''{1}'' was passed a negative index for the dictionary ''{2}''. This might be an internal error, or there might be a problem with the dictionary. \n\nRedeploy the message dictionary and verify that no errors were reported. Ensure that the dictionary that is deployed is the dictionary specified in the input message (or input node on the message flow). Review further error messages for an indication of what caused the errors. 

5168: BIP5168E: \
A Custom Wire Format writing error occurred involving an incorrect data conversion. Element ''{2}'' is either too long, or is out of range for the physical data type of ''{3}''. \n\nWhile the logical tree was being written to the bit stream, a data conversion or data overflow error occurred. \n\nChange the definition of the element so that it can store the data safely. Alternatively change the message that is being written so that the value is in the correct range for the element. 

5369: BIP5369E: \
Message Validation failure. Invalid value for element {0}.  The value {1} does not match the pattern {2}. \n\nThe value for the element does not match the pattern specified for the element. \n\nModify the message set or messageflow and redeploy to the integration node or modify the input message and resubmit to the integration node.  \nSee following the messages for more details. 

5183: BIP5183E: \

Message validation error. An element has exceeded its maxOccurs constraint.  element: {0}  instances: {1}  maxOccurs: {2} \n\nElement ''{0}'' has ''{1}'' instances in the logical tree, but has been defined with a maxOccurs constraint of ''{2}''. \n\nTrace the message tree, and compare it to the message definition used for validation.  \nAlter the message set, increasing the maxOccurs constraint, and redeploy to the integration node.  \nAlternatively decrease the number of instances of the element in the message itself. 

5458: BIP5458E: \
The TDS physical format does not support an unbounded number of occurrences for element ''{0}'', because it is contained in a fixed length choice. \n\nA choice contains element ''{0}'', which is defined with a ''max occurs'' of -1 (unbounded). This option is not supported within a fixed length environment for a choice, because it must be possible to calculate the length of each member of the choice. \n\nModify the message model to ensure that no elements contained in a fixed length choice repeat an unbounded number of times. Check the repeats of element ''{0}''.

5335: BIP5335E: \
A message dictionary error has occurred. A null property name error occurred in function ''{1}'' while it was processing dictionary ''{2}''. \n\nStandard dictionary error: The function ''{1}'' reported a null property name error while it was processing the message dictionary ''{2}''. This might be an internal error, or there might be a problem with the dictionary. \n\nRedeploy the message dictionary and verify that no errors were reported. Ensure that the dictionary that is deployed is the dictionary specified in the input message (or input node on the message flow). Review further error messages for an indication of what caused the errors. 

5316: BIP5316E: \
A library error occurred during loading of the MRM bitstream worker ''{1}''. \n\nThe integration node has attempted to load the ''{1}'' bitstream worker. However, this attempt was unsuccessful.  \nThe bitstream worker libraries are used by the MRM domain to process messages with a particular physical representation. The following list identifies the relationship between an MRM parser and the required library files:  \n Custom Wire Format (CWF) : ''bipcwfworker.wrk'' or ''bipcwfworker64.wrk''  \n Tagged/Delimited Format (TDS) : ''biptdsworker.wrk'' or ''biptdsworker64.wrk''  \n MRM XML Format : ''bipxmlworker.wrk'' or ''bipxmlworker64.wrk''  \nAttempts to process messages with the physical format identified above will not be successful until this problem is resolved. \n\nThe bitstream workers are loaded when the integration node starts an integration server (DataFlowEngine instance).  \nCheck that the ''{1}'' bitstream worker library (dll or shared object) exists in the correct directory. On a Windows platform the library files should be located in the <Install Dir>\bin directory. On all other platforms the files should be located in the <Install Dir>/lib directory.  \nCheck the application event viewer (or system log) for error messages when the integration node is started or when a message set is deployed to the integration node.  \nAlso check that the user ID under which the integration node is executing has sufficient privileges to load the file. 

5362: BIP5362E: \
Message validation error. The value ''{1}'' for element ''{0}'' in the message is not valid.  The value is greater than the maximum inclusive value ''{2}''. \n\nThe value for the element in the message is greater than the maximum inclusive value specified for the element. \n\nModify the message set or message flow and redeploy to the integration node, or modify the input message and resubmit to the integration node.  \nSee the following messages for more details. 

5306: BIP5306E: \
Resource manager: Bitstream worker initialization error, for format ''{2}''. \n\nThe creation of a bitstream worker object failed: format name: {2}. The resource manager was unable to find the requested worker in the cache, and subsequently was unable to load it into the cache. This might be caused by a memory allocation failure. It could also be caused by a corrupt worker file (dll or shared object file with the extension .wrk), or the requested file might not be available. \n\nExamine memory usage and increase memory available to the integration node. Check that the appropriate bitstream worker file (dll or shared object) exists in the correct directory. .wrk files reside in the <install dir>\bin directory on Windows, and in <install dir>/lib on other platforms.  \nThe following list identifies the relationship between an MRM parser and the required library files :  \n Custom Wire Format (CWF) : ''bipcwfworker.wrk'' or ''bipcwfworker64.wrk''  \n Tagged/Delimited Format (TDS) : ''biptdsworker.wrk'' or ''biptdsworker64.wrk''  \n MRM XML Format : ''bipxmlworker.wrk'' or ''bipxmlworker64.wrk''  \nIf the problem cannot be resolved it is recommended that you reinstall the product. 

5207: BIP5207E: \
Message Translation Interface error. Invalid Relative Position: message set ''{2}''; message ''{3}''; parent element ''{4}''; current element ''{5}''; function name ''{1}''; error code ''{0}''. \n\nThe ''Relative Position'' parameter passed into the Message Translation Interface function is not valid. \n\nRecord the full details provided with this message and contact your IBM support center. 

5502: BIP5502E: \

5330: BIP5330E: \
A message dictionary error has occurred. Tag ''{3}'' was not found when function ''{1}'' was processing dictionary ''{2}''. \n\nMtiImbParser:Standard dictionary error: A definition was not found. The function ''{1}'' was unable to find the tag ''{3}'' in the dictionary ''{2}''. This might be an internal error, or there might be a problem with the dictionary. \n\nRedeploy the message dictionary and verify that no errors were reported. If the message type is included in the input message verify that it is a member of the message set specified. Verify that the message instance corresponds to the dictionary specified. Review further error messages for an indication of what caused the errors. 

5357: BIP5357E: \
The message type path ''{2}'' is incompatible with message type prefix ''{1}'', in message set ''{0}''. \n\nThe error may have occurred because there is a message type prefix specified in message set ''{0}'' but the message type path is relative (does not start with the ''/'' character) instead of absolute. \n\nCheck that the message type prefix combined with the message type path resolves to a valid complete message type path. Make sure that there is correct use of a leading ''/'' character for absolute paths. 

5608: BIP5608I: \
''{0}'' has been matched as a group terminator for ''{1}'' at byte ''{2}''. 

5504: BIP5504E: \
Read of text element failed. Null terminator not found.  Message data : ''{0}''  Search for null terminator started at offset {1}. \n\nThe reading of a text element of a message failed because the expected null terminator was not found.  \nCheck that the message model is correct. Review previous messages for details of the message set and message type.  \nCheck that the processed message is of the expected format and type. 

5218: BIP5218E: \
Message Translation Interface error. Invalid message name: message set ''{2}''; message ''{3}''; parent element ''{4}''; current element ''{5}''; function name ''{1}''; error code ''{0}''. \n\nThis error code is returned by the function MTIGetMessageIdent when the message name parameter does not specify a valid message. \n\nRecord the full details provided with this message and contact your IBM support center. 

5633: BIP5633S: \
The data length of element ''{0}'' does not equal the tagged encoded length.  Physical type: Null Terminated String  Tagged encoded length: {1} characters  Data length: {2} characters \n\nThe data element separation of the parent is ''Tagged Encoded Length''. The physical type of the element is ''Null Terminated String''. The length of the string that is specified by the null terminator does not equal the tagged encoded length in the input message. The tagged encoded length must be one greater than the string length to take into account the null terminator.  \nSee subsequent messages for details of the message set and the physical format. \n\nOne of the following actions might resolve the problem:  \n1. Check that the tagged encoded length for the element in the input message is correct.  \n2. Check that the data for the element in the input message is correct. 

5410: BIP5410E: \
XML parsing error: An unresolved union error occurred for element or attribute ''{0}'', of type ''{1}''. \n\nThe element or attribute ''{0}'' is based on union type ''{1}''. The value of ''{0}'' could not be cast to any member of the union. \n\nCheck that the message contains a valid value for element or attribute ''{0}''.  \nCheck that union type ''{1}'' contains the correct list of simple types.  \nConsider using an xsi:type attribute to resolve the union explicitly. 

5242: BIP5242E: \

5545: BIP5545E: \
DateTime entered is invalid, as leniency is not set. \n\nCheck and possibly correct the entered datetime. Remember the calendar is not lenient. 

5353: BIP5353E: \
A mismatch between the message type prefix ''{1}'' and the message type path ''{2}'' has occurred, for a message in message set ''{0}''. \n\nThe message type prefix, ''{1}'', specified for message set ''{0}'', was incompatible with the specified message type path, ''{2}''. \n\nThis error is most commonly caused by specifying the message type path as an absolute path (prefixed with ''/''), while also having a different message type prefix specified for the message set.  \nEnsure that the correct message set has been deployed for the message being parsed.  \nIf the message set property ''Message Type Prefix'' is specified, and the message is using an absolute message type path, ensure that they match.  \nMake sure the message conforms to the structure specified by the message type path.  \nIf the problem still occurs, record the full details provided with this message and contact your IBM support center. 

5243: BIP5243E: \
Message Translation Interface error. Buffer full: message set ''{2}''; message ''{3}''; parent element ''{4}''; current element ''{5}''; function name ''{1}''; error code ''{0}''. \n\nInternal error.  This error indicates that a memory buffer, used while putting a message to bitstream, has filled completely. \n\nCheck that you have a valid integration node installation.  If the problem persists contact your IBM support center. 

5133: BIP5133E: \
An internal MRM parser error occurred. \n\nResource manager handle is not valid. When parsing an MRM message the integration node requires a valid Message Translation Interface Resource manager handle which should have already been initialized. \n\nRecord the full details provided with this message and contact your IBM support center. 

5382: BIP5382E: \
Resource Manager: A duplicate message set name ''{2}'' was specified. \n\nA message set deployment request for message set ''{2}'' has been received by the integration node. However, the integration node already has a message set registered with the same ''Message Set Name'' but a different ''Identifier''. This would result in an ambiguous resource being registered and thus the request has been rejected. \n\nThe integration node was requested to register a runtime message set resource (dictionary) using an ambiguous ''Message Set Name''. The most likely reason for this error is that there is already a message set deployed with this name, but with a different identifier. You should either remove the existing message set deployment or change the name of the message set currently being deployed. 

5401: BIP5401E: \
XML Worker: An internal error occurred. Diagnostic information: {0}. \n\nAn internal error occurred during the operation of the XML Worker. \n\nPlease contact your IBM support center.

5319: BIP5319E: \
Resource Manager: Already Initialized. \n\nThis is an internal program error which occurs when an attempt is made at initializing the Resource Manager more than once. The initialization occurs in the rmInitialise() method in the MtiImbParser factory class constructor. \n\nTrace files for the integration server should be collected. Record the full details provided with this message and contact your IBM support center. 

5326: BIP5326E: \
A message dictionary error has occurred. An invalid member ID was passed to function ''{1}'' when it was processing element ''{3}'' of dictionary ''{2}''. \n\nStandard dictionary error: The function ''{1}'' has received an invalid member ID when it was processing the element ''{3}'' in the dictionary ''{2}''. This can be an internal error, or there might be a problem with the dictionary. \n\nRedeploy the message dictionary and verify that no errors were reported. Ensure that the dictionary that is deployed is the dictionary specified in the input message (or input node on the message flow). Review further error messages for an indication of what caused the errors. 

5459: BIP5459E: \
The TDS physical format does not support union types. Element ''{0}'' attempts to use a union type. \n\nAlter the message model to remove the union type, then redeploy. 

5328: BIP5328E: \
A message dictionary error has occurred. An invalid index was passed to function ''{1}'' when it was processing dictionary ''{2}''. \n\nStandard dictionary error: The function ''{1}'' was passed an invalid index when it was processing the dictionary ''{2}''. This might be an internal error, or there might be a problem with the dictionary. \n\nRedeploy the message dictionary and verify that no errors were reported. Ensure that the dictionary that is deployed is the dictionary specified in the input message (or input node on the message flow). Review further error messages for an indication of what caused the errors.

However the neighboring integration node''s definition for this integration node has used a different UUID from that which this integration node is running under. This may occur because an integration node at one end of a connection in the integration node topology has not been running for some time, and may receive old configuration messages from integration nodes which have since been reconfigured. \n\nEnsure that the communication paths exist between both integration nodes, and are running correctly. If the integration nodes do not subsequently connect successfully (which will be identified by another message), reestablish the integration node topology by redeploying. If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

7281: BIP7281W: \
Request ''{0}'' from IBM publish/subscribe integration node ''{2}'' contains an invalid topic ''{1}''. \n\nThe integration node has received a request from a neighboring IBM publish/subscribe integration node. The request contained an invalid topic and will be ignored. \n\nIn a mixed network of IBM Integration Bus and IBM publish/subscribe integration nodes it is not possible for information to flow between the two types of integration node on topics which contain wildcard characters # or +.  Client applications within the IBM publish/subscribe network need to be modified to use topics which do not contain characters which are invalid to the IBM Integration Bus integration node. 

7106: BIP7106W: \
Accepting integration node {0} (queue manager {1}) is currently unknown. \n\nAn integration node (identified by its UUID {0} and queue manager {1}) has been defined with this integration node as a neighbor, and has sent this integration node a connection acceptance message. This integration node is not currently configured for the other integration node, although it was at some time in the past. This may occur because an integration node at one end of a connection in the integration node topology has not been running for some time, and may receive old configuration messages from integration nodes which have since been reconfigured. \n\nEnsure that the communication paths exist between both integration nodes, and are running correctly. If the integration nodes do not subsequently connect successfully (which will be identified by another message), reestablish the integration node topology by redeploying. If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center. 

7393: BIP7393W: \
The integration node multicast protocol has been set to PGM/IP. However, the integration node is not running with sufficient authority. The integration node will revert to UDP encapsulated PGM. \n\nPGM/IP requires the integration node to be run with administrator privileges. The integration node has been started without this authority. PGM/IP will not be available. \n\nRestart the integration node with administrator privileges to use PGM/IP. 

7409: BIP7409S: \
The integration node was unable to create a JVM. The return code indicates that an unrecognized option was passed in to it. The integration node may be being run with a different level of Java than it was shipped with. The options supplied were: {0} \n\nThe creation of the integration node JVM failed with a return code indicating that an argument was not recognized. It is likely that this has been cause by the integration node trying to run a different level of Java than it was shipped with. \n\nCheck that the integration node profile has been run before starting the integration node and insure that the library path contains the integration node JRE lib directories. 

7074: BIP7074E: \
Exception ''{1}'' condition detected while recovering client ''{0}'' from the database. \n\nAn exception condition was detected in the integration node when trying to recover a client from the database. \n\nEnsure that the client id exists and is valid and re-try the operation. 

7356: BIP7356S: \

7277: BIP7277E: \
IBM Integration Bus integration node has failed to subscribe to IBM publish/subscribe integration node {0}. Reason codes {1} and {2}. \n\nThe strmqbrk command has been issued at IBM publish/subscribe integration node {0} nominating this IBM Integration Bus integration node as its parent.  While handling the resultant join request the IBM Integration Bus integration node sent an internal subscription to the administration stream of integration node {0}.  The subscription failed and as a result the two integration nodes are not yet joined together.  The integration node will reissue the subscription immediately. \n\nInvestigate why the problem occurred and take appropriate action to correct the problem.  The most likely cause of this failure is a problem with the SYSTEM.BROKER.CONTROL.QUEUE at integration node {0}, or a problem with the definition of route between this integration node and integration node {0}. When the problem has been rectified this error message will no longer be issued. If you cannot rectify the problem then consider reversing the attempted joining of the two integration nodes. This can be achieved using the clrmqbrk command at integration node {0} and the mqsiclearmqpubsub command at this integration node. 

7080: BIP7080I: \
Node ''{2}'': The Publication Node with Subscription Point ''{1}'' has received a message of type {0}. \n\nThe Publication Node with Subscription Point ''{1}'' has started processing a message. \n\nNo user action required. 

7091: BIP7091E: \
Caught exception ''{2}'' while deregistering subscriptions for client id ''{0}'': error code ''{1}''. \n\nThere was a problem while attempting to deregister all subscriptions for a client. \n\nDue to the error deregistering the subscription, the subscription state of the integration node may be inconsistent.  It may be necessary to restart the integration node to eliminate the problem. If the problem persists, you should contact your IBM support center. 

7017: BIP7017W: \
Unknown user {0}. \n\nThe user {0} was not found in the security information. \n\nThis may be an unauthorized user.  However, if you expect the user to be able to access the integration node, then this is an internal error, and you should contact your IBM support center. 

7054: BIP7054S: \

7267: BIP7267S: \
Invalid IBM Publish/Subscribe control message detected on queue ''{2}'': diagnostic information ''{0}'', ''{1}''. \n\nThe integration node has been processing messages on a queue. Messages are sent to the queue by neighboring IBM Publish/Subscribe integration nodes or as a result of the mqsijoinmqpubsub or mqsiclearmqpubsub commands being issued.  The integration node has detected an invalid message on the queue. The message will be backed out and retried until such time as the backout threshold of the queue has been exceeded at which time it will be put to the dead letter queue. \n\nThis is an internal error, contact your IBM support center. The diagnostic information will need to be reported along with the message which is causing the problem.  To recover from this problem, set an appropriate backout threshold for the queue which will cause the invalid message to be put to the dead letter queue.  From here the message can be captured by running the amqsbcg sample program against the dead letter queue and saving the output to a file. If you do not have a dead letter queue, you will need to remove the invalid message manually from the queue.  The integration node will need to be stopped and again you should capture the invalid message by running the amqsbcg sample program against the queue before the message is removed. 

7030: BIP7030E: \
Publish/Subscribe state recovery failed. \n\nA problem was encountered when accessing the integration node database while processing transactional recovery for publish/subscribe information following some other error.  The available information is given above in other messages.

Requesting integration node {0} (queue manager {1}) is currently unknown. \n\nAn integration node (identified by its UUID {0} and queue manager {1}) has been defined with this integration node as a neighbor, and has attempted to make contact. As the requesting integration node is not currently known by this integration node, the request has been rejected. This message occurs because the configuration message updating the integration node topology has reached one integration node before the other.  If the communication paths between the integration nodes are set up and running correctly, this message will be followed by another one which will indicate that the connection between the integration nodes has been successful. If the communication paths are not set up correctly, no such message will be produced, and publications will not flow between the integration nodes. \n\nIf no message indicating the successful connection of the integration node is produced, ensure that the communication paths exist between both integration nodes, and are running correctly. If the integration nodes do not subsequently connect successfully (which will be identified by another message), reestablish the integration node topology by redeploying. If the problem persists, contact your IBM support center.

The format of the message received by the integration node has not been recognized. It may have been put on the wrong queue by an application. \n\nThe message will be left on the queue and will need to be removed from the queue before the integration node will continue to operate normally.  Browse queue {0} to determine the source of the invalid message.  Remove the offending message from the queue and restart your integration node.  If the offending message was not put onto the queue by one of your applications, capture the message and all other diagnostic data contained within this message and contact your IBM support center. 

7264: BIP7264W: \
Integration node could not send completion code ''{0}'' to a command line request. \n\nAn mqsijoinmqpubsub or mqsiclearmqpubsub request has been made from the command line. The request has been processed by the integration node, but a failure has occurred when trying to respond to the reply queue used by the command line program. If the completion code is zero, the request succeeded. A nonzero completion code means that the request failed or was rejected by the integration node. \n\nLook for a previous error message, usually BIP2623, outlining the cause of the problem. If message BIP2623 reports a WebSphere MQ reason code of 2085 or 2052, this means that the temporary reply queue used by the command line program no longer exists, perhaps because Ctrl-C has been pressed or the request has timed out. Any other reason code is unexpected and should be looked up in the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference manual.

The request message cannot be sent to WebSphere Process Server. \n\nAn operation specified in the Local Environment was not found in the interface that is defined in the Broker SCA Definition. The request message cannot be sent because the operation does not exist in the application that is running on WebSphere Process Server. \n\nCorrect the value for the specified operation in the Local Environment. If necessary, re-export the project interchange file from WebSphere Integration Developer, and then import it into IBM Integration Bus. This import operation updates the Broker SCA Definition, which can then be used to reconfigure the SCARequest or SCAAsyncRequest node. 

3825: BIP3825E: \
A SCAAsyncResponse node with the identifier ''{0}'' cannot not find its corresponding SCAAsyncRequest node. The number of checks so far is: {1}.

3829: BIP3829E: \
SCARequest node ''{0}'', which is using a MQ SCA binding, did not receive a response message within the timeout period. \n\nThe SCARequest node sent a request message, and is configured to receive a response. However, the response message did not arrive before the specified timeout period elapsed. \n\nCheck the logs on WebSphere Process Server to see why the response message was not sent. Possible reasons include: 1) The properties in the SCA Export component on WebSphere Process Server have been changed, and the response queue or response queue manager is different from that specified in the SCARequest node properties. In this case, export the Project Interchange file from WebSphere Integration Developer and import it into IBM Integration Bus. This import operation updates the Broker SCA Definition, which you can then use to re-configure the SCARequest node. 2) The interface used by the SCA Export has changed, and the request operation has been removed or renamed, but has not been updated in IBM Integration Bus. In this case, export the Project Interchange file from WebSphere Integration Developer and import it into IBM Integration Bus. This import operation updates the Broker SCA Definition, which you can then use to re-configure the SCARequest node. 3) The application running in WebSphere Process Server requires human intervention, which takes longer to complete than the specified timeout period on the SCARequest node. In this case, increase the timeout period specified on the SCARequest node. 

3811: BIP3811E: \
The SCAInput node ''{0}'', which is using a Web services SCA binding, encountered an error while initializing the environment. \n\nAn internal error occurred during initialization. \n\nSee previous error messages to determine the cause of the error.

3827: BIP3827E: \
A message with more than one message body reached SCA node {0} (binding ''{5}''). Extraneous body parser name is {6}. \n\nThe IBM Integration Bus node ''{4}'' has received a message for writing to a queue, but there is more than one message body present in the tree. This situation can occur when a message is built incorrectly by a Compute node. \n\nModify previuos nodes to only create one message body and redeploy. 

3831: BIP3831E: \
The SCAAsyncRequest node ''{1}'' cannot be used to send a request message for a one-way operation ''{0}''. \n\nAn operation specified in the Local Environment is defined as a one-way operation in the Broker SCA Definition. The request message cannot be sent because SCAAsyncRequest node supports only request-response (two-way) operations. \n\nIf you want to send a request for a one-way operation, use the SCARequest node. If the specified operation was wrong, correct the value for the operation in the Local Environment. If necessary, re-export the project interchange file from WebSphere Integration Developer, and then import it into IBM Integration Bus. This import operation updates the Broker SCA Definition, which can then be used to reconfigure the SCARequest or SCAAsyncRequest node. 

3812: BIP3812E: \
The SCAInput node ''{0}'', which is using a Web services SCA binding, encountered an error while processing the node properties. \n\nAn internal error occurred during the processing of node properties. \n\nSee previous error messages to determine the cause of the error.

The SCAInput node ''{0}'', which is using a Web services SCA binding, encountered an error while propagating the inbound SOAP message to its output terminal. \n\nAn internal error occurred during message propagation. \n\nSee previous error messages to determine the cause of the error. 

3828: BIP3828I: \
The inbound message is a one-way WSDL operation; no reply will be sent. \n\nThe message flow includes a SCAReply node ''{0}'', but incoming messages use a one-way Message Exchange Pattern (MEP), and no reply is expected. \n\nRemove the SCAReply node ''{0}'' from the message flow. 

3805: BIP3805E: \
An SCAAsyncResponse node with the identifier ''{0}'' cannot find its corresponding SCAAsyncRequest node. It has checked ''{1}'' times for the corresponding node, and will continue checking. The SCAAsyncResponse node cannot receive any asynchronous response messages until it finds its corresponding SCAAsyncRequest node. \n\nIt is an error to deploy a SCAAsyncResponse node without its corresponding SCAAsyncRequest node. \n\nDeploy the corresponding SCAAsyncRequest node. 

3809: BIP3809E: \
The SCAInput node ''{0}'', which is using a Web services SCA binding, encountered an error while determining to which output terminal to propagate the message. \n\nAn internal error occurred during message processing. \n\nSee previous error messages to determine the cause of the error. 

3824: BIP3824E: \
The message received at SCA node ''{4}'' (binding ''{5}'') contains no data. (SQLSTATE ''{1}'') \n\nThe IBM Integration Bus node ''{4}'' has received a message for writing to a queue, but the bit stream of the message is too short to be a valid message. This situation can occur when a message is built incorrectly by a Compute node. \n\nCheck the message flow to determine whether the message is being built correctly. Correct the problem and redeploy. 

3814: BIP3814E: \
The SCAInput node ''{0}'', which is using a Web services SCA binding, encountered an error while processing the inbound SOAP message header. \n\nAn internal error occurred during the processing of security information in the message header. \n\nSee previous error messages to determine the cause of the error.
