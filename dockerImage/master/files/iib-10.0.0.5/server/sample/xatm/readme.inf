This directory contains a prebuilt MQSeries XA switch load file for Informix. 

In order to use these files, you must :-

1. Be using Informix Client SDK version 3.50.
2. Have run the mqsimanagexalinks command to create the symbolic links needed
   for XA coordination by WebSphereMQ.

For all other situations you must build an MQSeries switchfile as explained 
in the MQSeries System Administration manual.
