# java/lang/Terminator: 				has native pieces that must only be initialized once
# sun/misc/Unsafe : 					has native pieces that must only be initialized once
# com/ibm/oti/vm/AbstractClassLoader: 	must be singleton, initialized during Thread init
# com/ibm/oti/vm/BootstrapClassLoader: 	must be singleton, initialized during Thread init
# com/ibm/misc/SignalDispatcher: 		must be singleton as signals are JVM wide at this point
# sun/reflect/Reflection: 				must be singleton, since it is very tied to singleton Unsafe.
# java/lang/reflect/Proxy$MTProxy: 		must be singleton to avoid failure
# java/lang/invoke/MethodType: 			places instances in the constant pool which must match static state in the MethodType class
# com/ibm/lang/management/MemoryMXBeanImpl:	must have to be singleton to ensure the MemoryNotification thread to be created once for all tenants
# java/util/HashMap$StaticFieldHolderForMT: must be singleton to avoid lazy initialization failure in HashMap
